      "Text: Artist Nigel Cooke returns to Hastings for new show at Jerwood Gallery Nigel Cooke Published: 13:06 Wednesday 02 January 2019 Share this articleFrom January 19, Jerwood Gallery will premiere previously unseen and new works by critically acclaimed artist Nigel Cooke in an exhibition entitled Painter’s Beach Club.The show is something of a homecoming for Cooke - who mixes music, the weather and memories of growing up in Manchester to create his work - as Hastings is where he first had his paintings shown as a professional artist.Cooke said: “Coming back to Hastings after many adventures - in painting and the art world in general - to mount a show, has the feel of an odyssey. That’s the thing about painting; no matter how far you think you travel, you always end up back at the beginning.”He added: “A lot of my work has the shoreline as its location and, because Jerwood Gallery is by the sea, I wanted to focus on this aspect. Like all of us straining to get to the beach when the sun is out, I like to set my paintings at a similar frontier, an idealistic background that the painting can react to.”On display will be works previously unseen in a UK public gallery which the New York Times recently described as combining “magic realist illusion, post-apocalyptic fantasy and extreme shifts of scale.”Cooke’s paintings, frequently on vast canvases, feature somewhat dystopian landscapes, peopled by a variety of oddball and yet recognisable characters. Each painting demands close inspection as, among the weeds, stones and rubble will be found graffiti-like slogans, motifs and painterly references to his artistic heroes, such as Francis Bacon, Velazquez and Goya. Cooke likes to work at close range and at a distance, so it often seems like each painting contains many smaller ones within it.Growing up in the North of England, Cooke studied an art foundation course at Stockport College prior to pursuing a degree course at Nottingham Trent University. In 1997 he completed an MA at the Royal College of Art before being awarded a PhD in Fine Art from Goldsmith’s College, London (2004).Today, Cooke’s work hangs in major collections around the world, including the Tate, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Guggenheim.For more information visit www.jerwoodgallery.org.\n",

      "Text: When my son was born, I felt a new responsibility to make his world better, so I committed to recycling regularly. I also changed out a few light bulbs and planted a garden. Then, three years ago, I picked up Naomi Klein’s climate change masterpiece, “This Changes Everything.” And for the first time, I felt that no matter what I did on my own, it could never be enough.I am not alone. Yale Climate Communications recent survey headlines “ Americans are more worried about global warming, and show signs of losing hope .” Awareness is growing as more than six in 10 adults said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried about it, whereas fewer than half did in 2010.The American Psychiatric Association reports “Research indicates that extreme weather events such as large storms, flooding, droughts and heat waves are likely to become more frequent or more intense with climate change. Experiencing disasters related to climate and weather can cause significant stress and distress for many and contribute to more serious mental health issues.”What is the best antidote to feeling powerless about anything? Start doing something. Here are the steps I took to begin making a difference and being able to sleep at night.1. Read, listen and understand. Become climate change literate. What is it exactly and how does it work? There is a wealth of information out there. One of the best sites is citizensclimatelobby.org . These people know how to make a complex issue understandable. Now, make it personal. How is climate change affecting your region (agriculture, tourism, transportation, energy, economy). How does it affect your areas of interest (fly fishing, mountain biking, wildlife diversity, or skiing)? What do future forecasts and modeling predict for your area? Brace yourself; a bit of mental fortitude is helpful here for the somber news.2. Get involved using your special superpower! (You know you have one.) Given your unique talents, networks and skill-set, how can you contribute/advance climate change solutions? You might consider personal, community or national actions. Are you good at art, organizing, writing, teaching, researching or communication? This process may be an evolving path. Some individuals work best on their own, while others want the support and direction of an existing organization. Great organizations include: Citizens Climate Lobby, 350.org , Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and Climate Reality Project.3. Foster resilience. We’re in this for the long haul. My first big effort was to organize a community event to educate people about our food system as it relates to climate change with a documentary called “ Just Eat It: A Food Waste Story .” Let’s just say it was not well-attended, but I learned valuable lessons I used for my next event, and my next. Samuel Beckett, the great Irish playwright said it best: “Ever tried? Every failed? No matter. Fail again. Fail better.” Because every time you do, you’re moving us all forward.My favorite climate change books include, “Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming,” Paul Hawken; “Laudato Si: Encyclical on the Environment and Human Ecology,” Pope Francis; “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs Climate,” Naomi Klein; “Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?,” Bill McKibben; “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,” Peter Kalmus; “Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity,” James Hansen; “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,” Jared Diamond; “The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars” by Michael E. Mann.Good film documentaries on the subject include, “Chasing Ice,” “Chasing Corral,” “Years of Living Dangerously,” “Racing Extinction,” “Merchants of Doubt,” “Time to Choose,” “Tomorrow,” “Paris to Pittsburgh,” “Before the Flood,” “From the Ashes,” and “An Inconvenient Sequel.”Susan Atkinson , Durango, Colo., is a member of the Citizens Climate Lobby.\n",

      "Text: Summary New report from BC Hydro says the Dec. 20 windstorm across the South Coast was the 'most damaging' storm in its historyVANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – At its peak, it knocked out power to more than three-quarters-of-a-million customers.Now, almost exactly three weeks later, BC Hydro says that wind storm that pummeled the South Coast was the worst in its history.A new report out by the utility suggest the December storm’s impacts were larger than the windstorm that hit in August of 2015, BC Hydro adds, which affected both the Lower Mainland and the Fraser Valley. It was also more impactful than the windstorm of 2006 that swept across Vancouver Island, and “devastated Stanley Park.”This most recent even hit B.C. on December 20th. It left more than 400,000 customers without power on the Lower Mainland, and nearly 350,000 BC Hydro customers without electricity across Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.As crews continue #BCStorm restoration work, here's a look at some of the significant damage we're seeing from #VancouverIsland #Bamfield #GulfIslands from the past few days. pic.twitter.com/1VxMUgsAYw— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 24, 2018“It also required the biggest mobilization of people, equipment, and materials in BC Hydro’s history to respond to it,” Mora Scott with the utility said.The storm was the most damaging for a couple of reasons, she explained.“One it impacted more customers than we’ve ever seen before,” she told NEWS 1130 . “And it was the most damaging in terms of electrical infrastructure. More than 3,000 pieces of equipment were damaged during this storm that needed to be replaced.”The weather system brought with it winds with speeds of up to 100 kilometres per hour in some areas. It toppled trees and branches, many of which came crashing down onto electrical equipment.Restoring remaining customers continues to be a challenge due to extent of #BCStorm damage. Hundreds of individual outages remain that crews have to attend individually to make repairs, including restringing hundreds of spans of power lines & replacing power poles, transformers. pic.twitter.com/KfbUlYWa7R— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 23, 2018Scott said about 1,900 spans of wire, 390 power poles, 700 cross arms, and about 230 transformers were damaged.“We did have about 900 field workers working around the clock to make repairs and to rebuild parts of the system,” she added.Crews continue to make good progress & have restored power to around 600,000 customers total since #BCStorm hit on Thursday. As some customers are still without power we’ll continue to update the status of the hardest hit communities here: https://t.co/zZ7C1InV8t pic.twitter.com/R2L9IyzM2b— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 23, 2018Power was restored to more than half a million customers in the first 24 hours, the utility says. Crews were also brought in from other parts of the province and even outside of B.C.While crews have been called in from other areas in the past, Scott said “this was definitely the biggest mobilization of people, equipment, and material we’ve ever seen in our company’s history.”-With files from Estefania DuranRelated Stories More than 120,000 without power, trees down, as winds batter the Lower Mainland Person trapped on broken White Rock Pier rescued BC Hydro: Outages on Van Island and Gulf Islands restored by Dec. 31 Hydro crews work around the clock to restore power to British Columbians bc hydro | damage | electricity | historic | power | report | South Coast | storm | utility | windstorm\n",

      "Text: Close Still hungover in Ryder Cup success, golf enters 2019 with same obsession over Tiger Woods’ twilightGolf enters the new year in the same Woods obsessive cycle, the old will he won’t he, the can he really, the oh he hasn’t surely Click to followSportTwo moments just seven days apart drunk in euphoria and magnums of merriment defined golf in 2018. First there was the superlunary sight of Tiger Woods marching towards the 18th green at East Lake Golf Club, the maniacal claque of ‘I was there’ disciples leapfrogging the fairway rope to watch the teary-eyed 42-year-old win his first tournament in 1,876 days and complete one of sport’s most remarkable comebacks.Then just five rounds later Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood doused and danced in a rain of champagne in another greenside mob, this time on the outskirts of Paris as Europe downed a feckless USA in the Ryder Cup .It was but a speck of the golfing calendar in September – 168 hours to be precise – yet shrouded the entirety of what came before: the two major triumphs of Brooks Koepka , the table-topping ranking of Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson’s own return as he won for the first time in 101 tournaments.

The twilight hour stretched into days after Tour Championship victory. The pursuit of a coveted 15th major which means so much in the immediate but ultimately little if he isn’t to surpass Jack Nicklaus’ 18 continues. This time, though, Woods enters each time as the favourite.

Perhaps now we will accept that if someone is to seize the game by the scruff of its tweed-acred collar in 2019 as Woods did over two decade ago, it will come from a younger generation who looked up to Woods’ aura rather than lived in its shadow.Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau are those pole-placed princes in waiting. Both Ryder Cup rookies who spent their childhood fawning over Woods montages, the just turned 24-year-old Rahm crowned a year where he won three events, peaked at No 2 in the world rankings and finished fourth in two of 2018’s majors by defeating Woods in the Sunday singles in Paris.Maverick American DeChambeau, a year Rahm’s senior and famed for his rigid one-plane swing and wild neuroticisms, won four PGA Tour events and peaked at No 5 in the world rankings. Both have the ability to dethrone their hero and now too a maturity to wear his pelt. Rahm celebrates after defeating Woods in the singles in Paris (Getty)They will also jostle in the prolonged battle for world No 1 status, exchanged a record nine times between Koepka, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson last year like an unwanted crust.Rose remains the most relentlessly consistent player on the planet – his maiden victory in the season-long FedEx Cup a testament to that – but as he nears 40, adding to an unbecoming tally of a lone major victory in the 2013 US Open takes on total priority. Rose has contended at a major ever year since 2011 and Augusta, where he was felled in a playoff by close friend Sergio Garcia in 2017, has always been well-tailored to his straight-hitting.Ryder Cup teammate Fleetwood also holds hopes of of going one better having finished 2nd at the US Open and starred at Le Golf National, while the always tempestuous Tyrrell Hatton and ever wry Eddie Pepperell head a rich contingent of English challengers hoping to build on career-best seasons. Georgia Hall became England’s first Open champion for 14 years in 2018 (Getty)But, of course, the greatest golf feat of 2018 came on home soil and not by way of any of the aforementioned names when Georgia Hall stunned South Korea’s indomitable golfing division to become England’s first Open champion for 14 years.Next September, the 22-year-old will spearhead Europe in the 16th edition Solheim Cup which takes place at Gleneagles and promises a huge boost to the women’s game. Certainly, it is the only team event worth seconds in 2019 as the President’s Cup offers up another futile procession of patriotic fanfare as the USA conquer the ‘rest of the world’. In 12 editions of the lopsided tournament, the International Team has won just once.No in 2019 golf returns to traditional etiquette. The gaze reverted to the rolling summer months of majors, even if the PGA persist in trying to group them together on one slope as a way of transforming the season-ending Tour Championship into an informal fifth rather than another vulgar money-spinner.Speaking of which, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson won’t promise to spare us of another nauseating pay-per-view match either.\n",

      "Text: In Mexico, A Mayor Is Killed Within Hours Of Taking Office By Daniella Cheslow • 1 hour ago Alejandro Aparicio Santiago appears in a photograph issued by the Oaxaca state government. The newly elected mayor of the town of Tlaxiaco was killed within hours of taking office. Facebook.com/AlejandroAparicioMorena Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:01 amThe governor of the Mexican state of Oaxaca promises an investigation after a mayor of the town of Tlaxiaco was murdered. Gov. Alejandro Murat says a suspect is in custody.Alejandro Aparicio Santiago had just taken office Tuesday and was walking to his first official meeting at city hall when a group of gunmen opened fire. The mayor died in hospital, according to the Associated Press .Aparicio was a member of the Mexico's National Regeneration Movement, MORENA, the party of newly-elected President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The Oaxaca branch of the party issued condolences and a call for authorities to punish those responsible.Another MORENA politician was killed Sunday in the state of Morelos. The state government announced the death of María Ascención Torres Cruz on Twitter, writing, \"Que en paz descanse,\" Spanish for \"rest in peace.\"Last year more than 33,000 people were murdered in Mexico. NPR's Carrie Kahn reported that morgues overflowed and bodies were at times stored in refrigerated trailers, with residents complaining about the stench they generated.Holding public office can be particularly dangerous in parts of Mexico. The consulting firm Etellekt says that between September 2017 and August 2018, 175 politicians were murdered . That year included campaign season for the July 1 general elections.President Obrador campaigned on a platform of restoring order in Mexico by forming a National Guard. The new president has traveled with light security, riding in a Volkswagen sedan with only a handful of unarmed citizens providing protection , reports NPR.The Economist analyzed violence against mayors in Mexico and concluded that they were often targeted after they cracked down on corruption and local crime - or sometimes because they sided with gangs and were pursued by their rivals. In Oaxaca, the magazine noted, gangs were weak but mayors were killed in disputes over land. Unlike federal and state officials, who had heavy security, mayors are often exposed.Tlaxiaco is the hometown of the star of the film \"Roma,\" Yalitza Aparicio. It is unknown whether she is related to the slain mayor. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

      "Text: Business BureauMARKET observers find prevailing financial conditions ideal for share market and believe that the year 2019 would continue to attract large number of foreign institutional investors (FIIs). They feel that the market would touch new high in 2019 as many conditions are expected to go inline the expectations of the investors.However, they look very much concerned about the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls scheduled in the year. Director of Badjate Shocks and Shares Private Limited - Anuj Badjate said that the stock market would behave differently in first and second half of the year. “The first half, which is the preelection period, is expected to witness volatility.There will be uncertainty in the market because of which the market might lack the sense of excitement and cheer. And the market will behave as per the election results in the second phase (the post election phase),” he observed. However, investors should feel comfortable during the first week. Marginal ups and downs in the market will not affect them. But there may be some risk for traders who need to be very cautious,” he said. Badjate also said that micro and macro economic indicators are very positive which is a healthy sign. “Apart from this, the recent financial quarter had reflected growth in corporate profits.I think that there will be a turnaround in corporate profits and it would show significant rise in 2019. Fiscal deficit and inflation are in control which is another reason for bringing excitement in the market,” he said. “If we get stable Government, the post - election phase will see markets going up,” he said. Past Chairman of Nagpur Chapter of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India - Kailash Jogani said that Lok Sabha election would play dominant role in 2019. “The election results will decide the future of the share market.The market always welcomes stable Government. The market will closely watch all the pre-poll alliances of political parties and number of parties forming it. If there will be no clear majority to any one, the market will behave negatively,” he predicted. Commenting on other aspects, Jogani said that consolidation of Indian currency against dollar and falling prices of crude oil are going to bring cheer in the market.“If we set aside the Lok Sabha elections, other parameters are very positive for the market and think Nifty should cross the 12,000 mark in 2019.The year offers good opportunities for investors,” he said. Renowned Chartered Accountant and financial expert - Sameer Bakre also echoed similar sentiments. He said that political developments will keep on impacting the market. “The investors wish to see consistency in policies which is feasible only there is a stable Government in place. And thus market will watch every move of major political parties in the coming days,” he said.“Similarly, Monsoon will also leave its impact on the market. Otherwise, Bakre said, 2019 appears very bullish. “Right now there is stress on the country’s financial system. The Government is aggressively taking care of NPAs, spending huge money on infrastructure projects. which is going to attract investors and market would go northwards,” he said.\n",

      "Text: By Ashley Westerman • 2 hours ago A woman walks past a television in New Taipei City showing China's leader Xi Jinping making a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of a message sent to Taiwan in 1979. In his speech, Xi Jinping said Taiwan's unification with the mainland is \"inevitable\" and warned against any efforts to promote the island's independence. SAM YEH / AFP/Getty ImagesA Taiwan independent from mainland China is not an option, and no person or party can stop the trend toward \"unification,\" Chinese President Xi Jingping said in a policy speech Wednesday .While Beijing would seek a peaceful \"reunification\" with the self-governing island of over 23.5 million people, The Associated Press reports Xi said China wouldn't rule out using force if necessary. \"We are willing to create a vast space for peaceful unification, but we will never leave any room for any sort of Taiwan independence separatist activities,\" he said speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.Xi went on to say \"independence would only bring profound disaster for Taiwan\" and ensured the island a bright future under a one-country, two- system framework, according to Reuters.The Chinese president's urging for the two to come to the table came during a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the \"Message of Compatriots in Tawain\" when, on Jan. 1, 1979, China offered to open up communications and stop military action against the island. As NPR's Beijing Correspondent Rob Schmitz has reported previously , Taiwan split from China in 1949 when the U.S.-supported Chinese nationalist leadership fled after losing a civil war to communist forces.Then-president of Taiwan Chiang Ching-Kuo turned down Beijing's olive branch in 1979, reports Reuters, and later that year came out with the \"Three-Noes Policy\": no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.Decades later, China has again been rebuffed.In response to Xi's speech, current president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept Beijing's offered arrangement of \"one country, two systems,\" reports Reuters. In her own speech just the day before, Tsai, who is member of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, urged China to respect Taiwan's democratic values .More than 70 percent of Taiwanese believe Taiwan is already an independent country, according to an analysis done by The Washington Post. Unification with China has also become unpopular, the Post reports only one-third of Taiwanese citizens want to be part of China against — a drop from 60 percent who supported is in 2003.Only about 20 countries across the globe recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, which means different governments from Latin America to Africa have become drawn into the long-running diplomatic spat over the years. The U.S., which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from China, is no exception. While the State Department says the U.S. enjoys \"a robust unofficial relationship\" with Taiwan, right after his inauguration President Donald Trump called Xi and promised that Washington would stick to the \"One China\" doctrine. Then just a little over a year later, the U.S. dedicated a new complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has long functioned as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, NPR previously reported .Though he didn't name any country specifically, Xi warned Wednesday against foreign interference in China's \"Taiwan issue,\" saying family matters should be resolved by family members, reports the AP.

The Bookworm: Unraveling a mystery; modern motherhood Terri Schlichenmeyer, Columnist Published 5:02 a.m. ET Jan. 2, 2019 \"An Unexplained Death\" by Mikita Brottman. (Photo: Henry Holt) c. 2018, Henry Holt $28, $36.50 Canada; 273 pages Missing. That single word belies the deep panic and fear behind the reason for the poster it’s on. Someone's gone, not where he should be, and his family believes something’s wrong. They’re terrified because at some time in the ensuing days, as the poster falls to the elements and as you’ll read in “An Unexplained Death” by Mikita Brottman, missing can become mystery. In the early evening of May 16, 2006, Rey Rivera left his Baltimore home in a hurry, taking his wife’s car. He’d received what’s presumed to be a work-related phone call minutes before he left, but investigators still don’t know who called him. No one was ever able to ask because, days later, Rivera was found dead in Baltimore ’s Belvedere Hotel. He’d fallen through the roof into an abandoned office that had been a swimming pool in the Belvedere’s early years; but was now covered-over. The medical examiner said he hit the floor of the empty office, feet-first. More: The Bookworm: The alcohol at hand; shouldering the pain Mikita Brottman lived on the fifth floor of the grand old hotel-cum-condominium, and she was immediately captivated by Rivera’s passing. She admits that she’s always been fascinated in the “dark side,” in an X-Files sort of way, and death is of particular interest because of its unknowability. She admits that she’s tried all her life to experience the paranormal. She began digging deeper into what had become a mystery. Rivera was a tall athletic man, an immediately likeable kind of guy. He had a bit of a temper as a youth and was said to be impulsive with money, but his life seemed to be going well. Friends refused to believe that he killed himself. Though she’d never met Rivera, Brottman believed likewise but the more she learned, the odder the evidence. Rivera had just left a job that made him unhappy, for reasons that Brottman suggests were “tangled.” Details were forgotten, various players refused to speak with her, and documents were “lost.” And person after person after person warned Brottman to “be careful”… “An Unexplained Death” is the kind of book that’s perfect for the person who poked at road-kill as a child. It’s for the former kid who half-bravely half-thought about stumbling across a body in the woods someday, or who happily slept in a cemetery on Halloween. It’s creepy, and it’s very, very good. In her story, and that of Rey Rivera, author Mikita Brottman makes readers squirm. Not only do we learn a lot of shivery things about missing persons, but she also tells more about suicides, autopsies, and dead bodies than most true crime books would ever dare tell. Put it in a century-old hotel that’s seen its share of unsettling suicides, and you have a book that will make you cringe, check the locks, and read some more. Beware that this is not for anyone prone to nightmares. True crime fans may not like the personal injected into the process. But if you love a mystery that’ll leave you unnerved and twisting, “An Unexplained Death” should not be missed. “Forget ‘Having It All: How America Messed Up Motherhood – and How to Fix It' ” By Amy Westervelt c. 2018, Seal Press $27, $35 Canada; 309 pages First shift begins in early morning. You hit work then, and run all day for that weekly paycheck. Second shift starts the minute you pick up the kids and arrive home to run all evening until you fall into bed. Is this the way you wanted things to be or, after reading the new book “Forget ‘Having It All’” by Amy Westervelt, do you actually have too much?\"Forget 'Having It All: How America Messed Up Motherhood'\" by Amy Westervelt. (Photo: Seal Press) With two young children and a solid journalism career, Amy Westervelt is busy. She’s sometimes overloaded, which makes her think about motherhood in America versus motherhood elsewhere. Overseas, mothers get more support; here, not always so much. But to understand “why … motherhood in America kinda suck[s]” we first must know its history. Says Westervelt , America “was colonized by people who believed … in the power of self,” and that “led to both greatness and depravity.” It also led to a patriarchal society in which women “were seen as responsible for the moral character of their children” but men controlled white women’s lives, inheritances, childbirth, birth control, and most childcare decisions. Conversely, Black and Native American women generally reared their children communally – which, as it happens, is an ancient method and the way many societies raise their kids today. More: The Bookworm: Animal lovers, burro in; life's highway Modern mothers may enjoy more help from their spouses than their foremothers got but motherhood is still rather complicated. Women are criticized for “helicopter” mothering, and for giving their kids more freedom. They’re made to feel guilt for working, and for missing work when needed. They may be denied birth control but are given little-to-no governmental or societal support when they have children. Mothers of color, single mothers, and lesbian parents have these issues, and more. Says Westervelt, solutions start with demands for improved maternity leave, and for government-supported daycare. We should encourage boys to be nurturing. Passing the ERA would help, as would allowing better access to birth control. Finally, we need to stop shaming the choices women make, and “expand our notions of family to … go beyond the nuclear family.” While it’s true that a minute of browsing may tempt you to dismiss this book as just another feminist rant, hold up. Yes, author Amy Westervelt admits to both ranting and feminism and yes, there’s anger here. Still, “Forget ‘Having It All’” deserves a good second look. If nothing but for the history, this book will open eyes. You may think you know how your foremothers tried to raise families without losing identities, but Westervelt lays it bare again. You may think we’ve transcended old issues, but she shows how we’ve only re-arranged them. And you might think the grass is greener elsewhere, but she’s inclusive here: childless women and same-sex mothers don’t get off easy in today’s “messed up motherhood.” No doubt, this book is loaded with controversy, but it’s equally loaded with solutions. It’s one of those kinds of books that will make you want to take copious notes. If you’re so inclined, “Forget ‘Having It All’” may also be a book that shifts your thinking. The Bookworm is Terri Schlichenmeyer. She has been reading since she was 3 years old and never goes anywhere without a book. Terri lives on a hill in Wisconsin with two dogs and 11,000 books.

      "Text: Greek police hunt for 2 fugitives who escaped prison by The Associated Press Posted Jan 2, 2019 5:07 am PSTATHENS, Greece — Greek police have launched a manhunt for two inmates who escaped from Greece’s largest prison at Korydallos, west of Athens, apparently by cutting the bars of their cell and scaling the prison walls.Police said Wednesday the two men, brothers who were convicted of thefts and robberies, apparently escaped after the evening rollcall Tuesday night. Police say they cut through the bars of their cell and emerged into a small courtyard, from where they used a makeshift rope and hook made of bag straps and a rock to scale the prison’s outer wall.Prison authorities discovered the prison break Wednesday morning during rollcall. Authorities have launched an investigation into how the men managed to escape.The Associated Press Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).

Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images A police officer stands near the U.S. Capitol during a partial government shutdown in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP/Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, the last day of the trading year. Spencer Platt / Getty ImagesPresents were exchanged, carols were sung and the political news cycle kept on churning over the Christmas holiday.The days surrounding Christmas and New Year's Day saw the partial government shutdown begin, the stock market take a tumble (then recover) and President Trump make a secret holiday visit to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.As 2019 begins, here's a look at what you may have missed over the holidays.Saturday, Dec. 22Just after midnight, the partial government shutdown began after Congress failed to reach a deal on a spending bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said it was up to Democratic leaders to cut a deal with Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The partial shutdown is the third time the government was shuttered in 2018.Monday, Dec. 24The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst Christmas Eve performance in history , dropping 2.9 percent in just half a day of trading. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index fell more than 2 percent on the day.The volatile day on Wall Street followed an unusual public statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in which he said he spoke with the CEOs of the six largest banks in the country and was assured of their lending capacity.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Trump spent the day posting a flurry of tweets, including an attack on the Federal Reserve , a thank-you message to Saudi Arabia and several tweets about the border wall .Trump also tweeted that he was \"alone\" in the White House and \"waiting\" on Democrats to make a deal with him on funding the southern border wall.That evening, Trump and first lady Melania Trump participated in NORAD's annual Santa tracking event.In a clip that soon went viral on Twitter, Trump could be heard asking one young girl calling for an update on Santa's whereabouts: \"Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7 it's marginal, right?\"The girl, later identified by the Charleston Post and Courier as 7-year-old Collman Lloyd of Lexington, S.C., said she still believes in Santa after the phone call with Trump — while noting she had never heard the word \"marginal\" before.Tuesday, Dec. 25Trump took to Twitter Christmas evening to wish a Merry Christmas to \" everyone, even the Fake News Media. \" Earlier in the day he made phone calls to U.S. service members stationed overseas, and afterward vented to reporters about Democrats and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\"It's a disgrace, what's happening in our country,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.\"On the same day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala had died in U.S. custody , the second child in December to die in custody after being apprehended by the CBP.Immigration and Customs Enforcement also drew attention as the agency continued releasing hundreds of asylum-seeking migrants near a bus station in El Paso, Texas. Outgoing Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke responded to ICE's action by tweeting a call for donations for the families the agency released.Wednesday, Dec. 26The day after Christmas was a busy one. Here are the highlights: Trump and the first lady made a secret visit to U.S. troops in Iraq . It was the first such visit for Trump since he took office nearly two years ago, and it followed his order to pull out troops from Syria days before. NPR's Tamara Keith was one of the reporters on the trip and recounted her experience keeping the secret from everyone but two people: her husband and her editor. After the death of a second migrant child in U.S. custody, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced a series of new medical checks for migrants detained at the U.S. border and an increase in medical staffing along the border. The stock market roared back after its historic Christmas Eve losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,000 points, the largest single-day point gain in its history. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also saw big gains. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital after she underwent surgery for early stage lung cancer.Thursday, Dec. 27It became clear the partial government shutdown would last into the new year after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., advised members that no votes were expected in the House for the remainder of the week. Neither Trump nor Democratic leaders showed signs of backing down, each issuing statements blaming the other for the shutdown.One consequence of the continued shutdown: the Smithsonian announced it would close all of its museums and the National Zoo on Jan. 2 unless a spending deal could be reached.Friday, Dec. 28Nielsen traveled to the southern U.S. border after the death of two migrant children in U.S. custody, citing an \"unprecedented\" increase in the number of families and children being apprehended.The partial government shutdown stretched into its sixth day on Friday, and government workers living paycheck to paycheck began worrying about their ability to pay the bills should the shutdown continue.Saturday, Dec. 29Trump again took to Twitter to chide Democrats for not agreeing to his demands for border wall funding. The president also said on Twitter that \"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies....\"Trump also claimed \" big progress \" was being made on a trade deal with China as the trade war between the two countries continues.As New Year's Day approached, more impacts of the partial shutdown became apparent. For example, a group of volunteers descended on Joshua Tree National Park to scrub toilets, restock toilet paper and clean trash in place of the National Park Service. Among many other impacts, the Environmental Protection Agency also announced it would halt its operations.Monday, Dec. 31Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she would form an exploratory committee — essentially launching her 2020 presidential campaign . She made the announcement in a video emailed to supporters, touting her work on consumer financial protections and vowing that Trump could be defeated in 2020.In Capitol Hill news, a Democratic leadership aide said the House of Representatives will vote on a bill to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday — the day Democrats take control of the chamber. The bill will include full-year appropriations for six of the seven outstanding funding bills and temporary stopgap funding for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8.And on Wall Street, all three major stock market indexes closed 2018 down for the year .As 2018 drew to a close, our political journalists looked back on some of the most important stories of the year, including: The year in scandals , which saw three Cabinet secretaries depart over ethics concerns and two Republican lawmakers charged with crimes.

      "Text: Unexpected Ways The Government Shutdown Might Affect You By Cat Schuknecht • 3 hours ago Starting Wednesday, you won't be able to ride this bald eagle Wednesday at the carousel at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo, along with every Smithsonian museum, is closed to the public due to the partial government shutdown. Matt McClain / The Washington Post/Getty Images Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:12 amAs the federal government enters the second full week of its partial shutdown, federal workers aren't the only ones who will be affected.A new congressional session starts on Thursday, with Democrats as the majority in the House, but there's no indication that the shutdown will end before then.Consumers across the country might notice the consequences of the shutdown in unexpected places, from poop in parks to closed museums.Good night, gorilla: Every Smithsonian museum — even the National Zoo — is expected to close to the public on Wednesday. The institutions have relied on funds from previous years to stay open through the first of the New Year, but plan to close their doors on Jan. 2 if the government shutdown continues.\"It's really disappointing for our public because we know so many people come to Washington with plans to visit the Smithsonian museums, which are free,\" Smithsonian spokesperson Linda St. Thomas told WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons. \"And they really plan on that being a part of their visit to the city.\"Leave no trace: About two weeks into the shutdown, garbage and human waste are piling up in Yosemite National Park, The Los Angeles Times reported . The park has stayed stayed open since the shutdown began, making do with fewer resources, like bathrooms. Without access to restrooms, some park visitors are relieving themselves outside, but they aren't following the park services' recommendation to pack and carry out or bury their solid waste. As a result, some areas of the park, including \"all snow play areas,\" have been been closed .\"It's a free-for-all,\" Dakota Snider, who lives in Yosemite Valley, told The Associated Press on Monday. \"It's so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I've seen in my four years living here.\"Yosemite isn't the only park impacted by the shutdown; trash and toilets are a problem in Joshua Tree and Pinnacles National Park in California, and at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Other parks like Arches and Canyonlands in Utah and Yellowstone National Park have announced full or partial closures due to personnel shortages. And beware of checking nps.org for updates; the website won't be updated during the shutdown.Loans lost: Several government agencies that give out loans have had their purse strings tied by the federal shutdown.

      "Text: Crowdfunding Drives Funds And Attention Toward Questionable Medical Treatments By Rachel D. Cohen • 3 hours ago Sara Wong for NPRFor deep water divers who decompress too quickly, doctors may advise they lie inside a pressurized glass tube and inhale pure oxygen to treat painful symptoms known as \"the bends.\" The oxygen boost is thought to reduce swelling and prevent infection.The treatment, known as hyperbaric oxygen therapy or HBOT, is approved for a few other conditions , like carbon monoxide poisoning and a form of gangrene. But some clinics around the country offer it for numerous other health problems, including migraine headaches, depression, strokes, and even brain injuries. And HBOT hasn't been proven to work for most of these, according to the FDA .That hasn't stopped many people from fundraising for the treatment — and many other unproven or alternative treatments — on crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and YouCaring (GoFundMe bought YouCaring in April 2018 ).In two studies published recently, researchers ran systematic searches through crowdfunding sites to see just how pervasive this issue is. They identified thousands of campaigns raising millions of dollars for medical treatments that are not backed by science.\"It's wasteful both for the patient and the donor, and potentially dangerous,\" says Dr. Ford Vox , a brain injury specialist in Atlanta and the author of one of the studies.Crowdfunding for medical bills, treatments and related expenses has become common , often filling in the gaps when people don't have insurance or their insurance doesn't cover all their expenses. In 2017, one third of the money raised on GoFundMe globally was directed toward self-categorized medical campaigns, according to the company. The platform hosts about a quarter million medical campaigns each year that raise over $650 million.But some portion of those funds are for treatments of questionable value. Vox's study, published in JAMA in October 2018, looked at five alternative treatments to serious medical issues: Homeopathic treatments for cancer, hyperbaric oxygen treatments for brain injuries, stem cell treatments for brain and spinal cord injuries, and long-term antibiotic treatments for chronic Lyme disease. And Vox says they could potentially lead to harm, either from side effects of the treatment or from the lost opportunity to receive treatments known to be effective.Vox and a team of researchers identified over a thousand active campaigns for the five treatments posted from 2015 to 2017. The campaigns asked for over $27 million and had raised nearly $7 million. Because it only looked at the five treatments during a narrow time frame, Vox says this research is merely a snapshot of what could be a much larger issue.\"The biggest issue I'm concerned about is potentially feeding this whole dubious area of medicine, quote unquote, that has always existed,\" Vox says. He says that as the crowdfunding market expands, and the sheer dollar amount raised by campaigns increases, \"so does the money going to this alternative medicine marketplace.\"Another study published in JAMA in May 2018 focused specifically on stem cell treatments. The authors searched crowdfunding platforms for people seeking treatment at more than 300 direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics, and found 100 campaigns seeking $7 million total.\"It doesn't take much time rummaging around crowdfunding sites to realize that there are a lot of campaigns for people seeking stem cell therapies,\" says Leigh Turner , a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics, and one of the study's authors.Stem cell therapies use stem cells in injections or tissue transplants to try to treat or prevent diseases. The FDA has approved stem cell treatments that use cells from cord blood to treat a limited group of disorders affecting the body system that produces blood. It warns most other types of stem cell therapy are unproven, and can be unsafe.'A shining moment'Michelle and John Witkowski had reached a point of desperation when their niece started a GoFundMe fundraiser so Michelle could get a stem cell treatment for her multiple sclerosis.\"It was a shining moment,\" John says, when they learned about StemGenex, one of the direct-to-consumer stem cell treatment facilities Turner identified in his paper. A friend's wife who had the same particularly aggressive form of MS had gotten stem cell treatment there and said she regained feeling in her left arm, which she hadn't been able to use for a while. The Witkowskis just had to figure out how they were going to pay for the nearly $15,000 treatment.John says they were not the asking type of people. That is, even after liquidating their 401(k) plans and spending roughly a half a million dollars on treatments throughout Michelle's 10-year battle with MS, they were hesitant to ask people for money.Yet they felt they had to try. \"The idea of something that may be able to help gives me hope, something I haven't had in a long time,\" Michelle explained on her GoFundMe campaign page.That hope may have been misplaced. Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl , the director of UCLA's Multiple Sclerosis Program, says that while there is legitimate research on stem cell therapies for MS and other illnesses, there are no definitive results yet.\"There are people at well-vetted institutions doing this work, and when it is safe, it will be approved,\" she says. \"I don't think it's a good idea to do things that are not FDA-approved.\"Turner understands why people fundraise for alternative treatments when they're in desperate situations. But he thinks both the clinics that offer these treatments and the crowdfunding sites bear responsibility for promoting unproven treatments — and false hopes.Right now, Turner says, clinics can basically advertise how they please, which allows them to market to vulnerable individuals.\"Should you be allowed to just kind of put up a website and claim that you have a stem cell treatment, you know, and then start charging people thousands or tens of thousands of dollars?\" he asks.In their GoFundMe campaign, the Witkowskis asked for $20,000 for Michelle's treatment and the accompanying expenses. While their fundraiser only shows they made $2,500, John says they raised much more than that. Friends and family members donated directly to them or wrote checks to the treatment center, StemGenex. And when a hat was passed around at John's office, he remembers he collected a couple thousand dollars.But after the stem cell therapy, Michelle didn't seem to get any better.\"Nothing helped. There were no victories. It's such a bummer,\" John says. Michelle died just a few months later.In late October the FDA issued a warning letter against StemGenex, the clinic where Michelle Witkowski got her procedure. The letter says that the agency considers StemGenex's product to be a drug, and that the company's manufacturing and quality control procedures are not in compliance with federal regulations regarding drug manufacturing. It also warns that their marketing violates federal law.In addition, a pending lawsuit alleges the company's marketing practices are deceptive. StemGenex denies the allegations .StemGenex did not reply to numerous requests for comment on this story.Turner and Vox both say that because crowdfunding sites are involved in a transaction that directs funds to unscientific treatments, they should be involved in mitigating the issue, by educating people about the risk of unproven treatments or by putting systems in place to identify problematic campaigns.\"As an organization, GoFundMe needs to think much more carefully and critically about the extent to which they're creating a website that can lead to the spread of misinformation, and what they can do to promote health literacy,\" Turner says.GoFundMe uses algorithms to detect campaigns that violate its terms of service , including ones that raise funds for \"illegal drugs, narcotics, steroids, controlled substances, pharmaceuticals or other products that make health claims that have not been approved or verified by the applicable local and/or national regulatory body.\"But Turner says he thinks they aren't applying these standards rigorously enough. He wonders if GoFundMe will alert crowdfunders trying to raise money for treatments at StemGenex about the FDA's warning letter.GoFundMe addressed Turner's comment in an emailed statement to NPR: \"With these new concerns being raised surrounding certain stem cell clinics, we are taking a thoughtful approach to addressing stem cell campaigns while continuing to provide a safe and secure place for people to fundraise for their needs and causes.\"'This is my body'Zubin Master, an associate consultant at Mayo Clinic's Biomedical Ethics Research Program, questions the extent to which crowdfunding sites bear responsibility to monitor medical campaigns like Witkowski's. \"They're not in the business of scientific oversight,\" he says.And according to Master, FDA approval alone may not be enough to go on when determining whether people should be allowed to fundraise for a particular treatment on the platform.Master says there is a grey area in what is considered a legitimate treatment. Physicians are allowed to innovate, to try off-label uses of medications for instance, and the FDA does not scrutinize each step of the care they provide, he says. In fact, if certain regulatory requirements are met, the FDA permits patients with life-threatening conditions to access non-FDA-approved treatments with physician oversight under the Expanded Access program. Master says direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics do not typically meet the requirements for this program.Overall, Master says, some unproven treatments may be more legitimate than others (for instance, they may be the subject of rigorous research). So, for crowdfunding companies, trying to judge among a spectrum of treatments, is \"like drawing a line in the sand.\"With 50 million users, Master wonders how GoFundMe would logistically weed out campaigns for non-scientific treatments on a case-by-case basis. \"I'm not sure where you would draw the line,\" Master says.The e-mailed statement from GoFundMe said they have policies, tools, and experts to \"ensure the safety and protection of our community.\"The statement went on to say: \"Our role is to provide people with social fundraising tools to raise money for their cause or need. While we hope to be a helpful resource for personal fundraising, we believe it is not our place to tell them what decision to make.\"Pete Canfield ran a GoFundMe campaign seeking stem cell treatment for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2016. Doctors had told him the disease, which had reduced his breathing capacity, was terminal. He says he made the decision to try the stem cell treatment with his \"eyes open, understanding that it was not a verified procedure.\"He says he feels it was his right to try an experimental treatment. \"This is my body and I get to make the choices about what I'm going to do with this body, for the most part,\" says Canfield.Canfield sought $10,000 to pay for a $6,000 stem cell therapy at another one of the direct-to-consumer clinics Turner identified in his paper. Additional funds were for his travel to the clinic.He didn't have much luck, just raising over $1,000, but he paid for the rest out of pocket. In the end, the stem cell therapy did not work for Canfield. Still, he says he doesn't regret trying.\"Going to experimental procedures is quite often an act of desperation,\" he explains. \"It's what we see as the only option: 'I have to do this because if I don't do this, there's a good chance I'm going to die.' \"Rachel D.

      "Text: Laser diode system detects counterfeit olive oils02 Jan 2019Researchers at UCM Madrid and Scintillon Institute (US) develop sensor to detect fake oil – such as ordinary types sold as \"extra virgin\". The sensor can distinguish between apparently similar oils. Researchers at the Complutense University of Madrid , Spain, (UCM) and the Scintillon Institute in San Diego, Ca, US, have designed an optical sensor that can detect counterfeit olive oil labeled as extra virgin or protected designation of origin.The tool, reported in the Elsevier jornal Talanta , can distinguish between apparently similar oils that present notable differences in quality. This is possible thanks to the use of laser diodes, because the fluorescence emitted by adulterated oils is slightly different to that of pure “extra virgin” olive oils.Extra virgin olive oil is made from pure, cold-pressed olives, whereas regular olive oil is a blend, including both cold-pressed and processed oils, considered to be inferior in flavor, purity and appearance. A well-known example of fraudulent practice is adulterating fresh, pure virgin olive oil with inferior, cheaper olive oil or oils of another botanical origin.How it worksUsing a laser diode as a source light, the sample’s fluorescence emission is measured and 20 chaotic parameters from the resulting spectra have been calculated. Using these as independent variables of multi-parameter regression models, the concentration of adulterant can be estimated.The structure of the sensor has been designed and developed by a 3D printer and its developers say the device “has the potential of being applied in situ for real-time and cost-effective analysis at oil mills or for quality control.”The developers add that the tool is inexpensive both to manufacture and to operate. \"Other clear advantages of our tool include the possibility of conducting on-site analyses, as the equipment is the size of a briefcase. Furthermore, it generates results in real time,\" commented José S. Torrecilla, a senior lecturer and researcher in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials at UCM.The tool offers the olive oil sector a means to tackle an expensive problem. \"The quality of olive oil is recognised nationally and internationally. It is therefore necessary to protect this quality and combat fraudulent activities carried out with increasing frequency and skill in the sector,\" added Torrecilla.Chaotic algorithmsTo conduct the study, researchers mixed single-varietal oils of protected designation of origin with other protected designation of origin oils that were past their \"best before\" date. All the oils were purchased from grocery stores.Subsequently, mixtures were made using oils with between 1 and 17 percent acidity that were also past their \"best before\" date. Lastly, measurements were performed using the sensor, which was manufactured via 3-D printing, and the results were analyzed using chaotic algorithms.\"This technique is available for use at any time, and only requires oils prior to packaging for quality control or after packaging to detect fraudulent brands and/or producers,\" concluded Torrecilla.\n",

      "Text: By Carrie Johnson • 3 hours ago A flag flies outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration's reshaping of the federal judiciary continued at a steady pace, with 18 new appeals court judges confirmed in 2018. Eric Thayer / Getty ImagesThe Trump administration more than doubled the number of judges it confirmed to federal appeals courts in 2018, exceeding the pace of the last five presidents and stocking the courts with lifetime appointees who could have profound consequences for civil rights, the environment and government regulations.A new analysis by Lambda Legal , which advocates for the LGBT community, reports that five of the country's 12 circuit courts are now composed of more than 25 percent of Trump-appointed judges.The report concludes that the 8th Circuit, which covers Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, has experienced the \"most significant transformation,\" followed by the 7th Circuit across the U.S. Midwest and the 5th Circuit, which spans Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana.Those courts play a major role in shaping the law, since they are often the destination of last resort. The Supreme Court agrees to hear only a small percentage of the petitions it reviews.\"Judges protect what we value most in society. No matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, or who you love, we all deserve judges who can be fair and impartial,\" said Sharon McGowan, legal director and chief strategy officer at Lambda Legal. \"That's why protecting our courts needs to be a two-party job. Democrats and Republicans alike owe it to the American people to ensure that the federal courts remain an impartial institution administering 'equal justice for all,' not just the wealthy and the powerful.\"Lambda Legal has closely followed the Trump judicial picks, because it argues the administration has been selecting candidates with a \"hostility\" toward LGBT people. That includes a judge who wrote that transgender people are \"delusional,\" and another who sat on the board of the Nebraska Family Alliance, which advocated for conversion therapy and against marriage equality.To conservatives, the Trump approach to judges represents the administration's most enduring legacy and a central reason he won the White House. Many of the Trump nominees are members of the Federalist Society, an elite group that has made a point of creating a pipeline of future judges.Last year, at its annual gala, the group honored former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — a nod to their success in confirming federal judges.In a year-end fundraising letter for 2018, the Society reported that its network now numbers 75,000 people and \"we are on the eve of closing a calendar year that was hardly imaginable in our early days.\"It continued: \"Our members--students, lawyers, law professors, legislators, public officials and more--are filling key positions in state and federal governments, in academia, and the private sector.\"The trend on judges is likely to continue this year, since Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. McConnell often points to confirming judges as a key success of the GOP-controlled Senate since Trump was elected. It's a message that may have boosted the enthusiasm of conservative voters in the midterm elections, particularly with the heated confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh coming just weeks earlier.Since Democrats won control of the House, effectively blocking the conservative legislative agenda for two years, confirming judges and other presidential appointees in the Senate is perhaps the clearest avenue for Trump to advance his agenda before facing re-election in 2020.With that political reality in mind, left-leaning groups know they are facing an uphill battle in the judiciary.Christopher Kang, chief counsel at the advocacy group Demand Justice, said he's \"heartened\" that Senate Democrats refused to do a deal to confirm more Trump picks at the end of 2018.But, he added, \"it's not enough for Democrats to simply stop fast-tracking Trump's judges — we have been calling on them to oppose every one. Trump's nominees are the most conservative in history, and Republicans have broken every rule, custom and norm possible to steamroll the Senate's constitutional responsibly. It's time for Democrats to do everything they can and unite in their opposition.\"Kang also pointed out that for all of Trump's success in filling judicial vacancies, only one African-American and one Hispanic judge have won confirmation in the Trump era.

      "Text: The Latest: Russian apartment collapse death toll hits 21 by The Associated Press Posted Jan 2, 2019 4:30 am PSTMOSCOW — The Latest on the building collapse in Russia (all times local):3:25 p.m.Russian emergency officials say the death toll in the collapse of an apartment building has risen to 21 after the recovery of two more bodies from the rubble.The discovery of the bodies on Wednesday afternoon leaves 20 residents of the building in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk still unaccounted for. Prospects of finding anyone alive in the rubble have diminished sharply after two nights of harsh cold, with overnight temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).A section of the 10-story building collapsed on Monday following an explosion believed to have been due to a gas leak.___1:50 p.m.Search crews have pulled more bodies from a huge pile of rubble at a collapsed Russian apartment building, bringing the known death toll to 19.The bodies found on Wednesday in Magnitogorsk included a 3-year-old girl, Russian news agencies cited the emergencies ministry as saying.An 11-month-old boy who was pulled alive from the wreckage on Tuesday nearly 36 hours after the building collapsed was in serious but stable condition in a children’s hospital in Moscow. He was flown about 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) to the capital in a plane dispatched by the Health Ministry.Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said Wednesday the boy suffered superficial head wounds but no apparent brain damage.More than 20 people who lived in the building remain unaccounted for, including five children.The Associated Press\n",

      "Text: By The Staff _No one can see the future, Save Jerseyans, but, as Scrooge discovered in A Christmas Carol , we’re sometimes able to glimpse “shadows of things that May be” should current events maintain their present trajectory.So yes, there are things which “we” (our regular contributors + insiders/veteran observers whom we informally polled to compile this list) can reasonably expect in New Jersey’s 2019 barring an environment-upsetting script flip over the next twelve months. And that’s the beautiful thing about the future! It isn’t written yet. We could be totally wrong on a few or even most predictions.Where a few of these predictions are concerned? We very much hope we’re wrong.For now, here are some predictions for the New Year:_ – MORE TAXES: The easiest one to predict by a mile! Democrat Senate President Steve Sweeney will cave and assent to a new round of massive tax hikes baked into the FY 2020 budget. Murphy will want more, Sweeney and Speaker Coughlin will argue him back a bit, and the legislative Dems will tout the resulting budget (the largest in N.J. history) as a “success.” It will be a success for Democrats in one very narrow sense of the word: a healthy number of Republicans will vote for the budget, giving Assembly Democrats running in battleground districts the cover they need to vote “no.” – MINIMUM WAGE: Legislation hiking New Jersey’s minimum wage will be passed and signed in 2019, but the state will opt for a circuitous route akin to what Seattle attempted as opposed to the relatively quick overnight hike to $15 per hour favored by the governor and the Democrat Party’s pro REgressive base. The seeds of division in New Jersey’s Democrat establishment — further fueled by a contentious state party chairmanship fight — will continue to take root. – LEGAL POT: Recreational cannabis legalization will be signed into law in 2019, too, but it won’t end up going into effect until after a prolonged period of regulation creation (the whole process has been rushed to date) and, when it finally launches, it will fetch only 2/3 of the revenue projected by Democrat leaders. Democrats will settle on a tax rate somewhere in the high teens. Murphy (left) and Brennan (right) – KATIE BRENNAN: Phil Murphy will survive the Katie Brennan scandal after some symbolic resignations and a tortured ‘apology’ for not doing more, but clear evidence that he KNOWINGLY ignored an alleged, credible female rape victim will haunt his long-term national ambitions in the same way that Bridgegate — and the persistent belief that Christie KNEW or approved of the plan to lean on Fort Lee’s Democrat mayor — bedeviled Murphy’s Republican predecessor (and continues to do so). – CHRIS CHRISTIE: …will conclude 2019 without a Trump Administration job. The Governor will surprise some by playing an active, behind-the-scenes role in the 2019 legislative elections here at home as well as the early stages of the 2021 gubernatorial race through the efforts of his long-time right hand man and NJGOP national committeeman Bill Palatucci. Christie’s new book – Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics – will be released on January 29th and end up being a moderate success driven by a substantial market for anything related to Trump. He will not re-friend Matt Rooney on Facebook or re-follow Save Jersey on Twitter. – ELECTION 2020 (Democrat): Actually THIS is the easiest one to predict! Gropacus (a/k/a Cory Booker) will announce a 2020 presidential campaign in early 2019 and spend most of his time Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina among other early primary/caucus states in addition to campaigning/fundraising for Democrat gubernatorial and legislative candidates across the country. Unfortunately for Booker, establishment options (like Biden and Clinton), the billionaire wildcard (Bloomberg), and the new leftist heroes of 2018 (like Beto and Gillium) will leave little oxygen in a crowded field for a well-known New Jersey candidate with a fraction of the purported electoral appeal to purple state voters of a Biden, Beto, or even a Gillium and less ideology purity (see Booker’s prescription drug votes) than some of other other popular options. He might make it to New Hampshire next winter. Might. – ELECTION 2020 (Republican): President Trump will host a reelection launch event by the end of 2019. One or a handful of GOP also-rans — like outgoing Ohio Governor John Kasich — will launch primary campaigns that go nowhere fast given Trump’s persistent popularity with a healthy majority of the Republican base. Trump will also end 2020 continuing to poll frustratingly well among Hispanic and Black voters. Trump’s strength with these groups (relative to Romney in 2012) may ultimately offset recent Republican weaknesses in affluent suburbs where the President’s style has turned off traditional GOP-leaning educated women. Only time will tell. Self-funders will announce in NJ-02, NJ-03 AND NJ-05; Seth Grossman will announce in the latter. Tom Kean Jr. will announce for NJ-07 but he will draw a primary challenge. – ELECTION 2019: Trump is the straw that’s breaking the back of a long-weakened New Jersey Republican establishment, and while “the bottom” is in sight, there’s still more losing ahead. Trenton Republicans are likely to suffer a narrow net loss in this year’s Assembly races; losses in Northern New Jersey suburban districts will be somewhat offset by pick ups in LD1 and LD2. Democrats may try to expand the map to LD12, LD26, and LD39, too, but those conquests will take more than one cycle. Republicans will fight like hell to hold on in Somerset and claw their way to a 2-3 minority on the Burlington freeholder board; the former fight will go to a recount, and the latter battle will come up a hair short. – IMMIGRATION: Trump and Democrats will reach a watered-down compromise on border security and DACA, one which leaves many unhappy on both sides of the aisle but one which also allows Trump to claim another legislative “victory.” His core supporters won’t mind; the shutdown will end with partial border wall funding, too. ICE will continue to clash with the Murphy Administration over this state’s sanctuary policies, conducting large-scale raids on a regular basis. – IMPEACHMENT: Mueller’s formal investigation will (finally) end and the President will come off looking bad in the final report. More indictments are coming. Trump will not be indicted notwithstanding the contents of Mueller’s final report, and the people who came out for him in 2016 knew he wasn’t an angel, so the political impact will be muted. House Democrats will fight among themselves over the far-left wing’s desire for a vote on articles of impeachment. The leadership will push back, worried about repeating the Republicans’ Clinton era impeachment mistake. Trump will raise a ton of money online off of the impeachment threat, giving the 2020 incumbent and his RNC a dramatic fundraising edge over the Democrat opposition. – ECONOMY: The stock market will continue to see-saw early in 2019 until a CR ends the partial government shutdown, though the threat of an impeachment vote continues to inject uncertainty into investors’ minds. A combination of cheap energy, growing wages, and a strong housing market nevertheless keep the economy growing albeit at a slower clip than it did throughout most of Trump’s first two years in office. New Jersey’s horrendous business tax climate and new taxes/regulations from the Murphy Administration will keep our state at the bottom of the national heap with anemic job growth._\n",

But I've been covering the ministry for six years.\"The ministry never really explained why it barred Kim. A spokesman simply said the ministry took \"necessary steps\" because of \"the special circumstance.\" He also noted that Kim is known for his \"active reporting,\" without elaborating.Its actions came at a time when the leaders of the two Koreas seem intent on taking unprecedented steps toward improving relations. The leaders of both countries met three times in 2018. Kim and other defectors believe that their experience of living under the North Korean regime gives them a role to play in this process.Kim speculates that officials shut him out because they were concerned that having a defector in the room could offend the North Korean officials and derail the talks.Kim is not the only defector turned journalist in South Korea, but he is the only one covering the Unification Ministry. This is the first known instance of the ministry targeting a specific journalist for exclusion.\"North Korea considers defectors as traitors to the country and the people,\" Kim explains, \"and they harshly criticize their activities in South Korea.\"Kim says his company has supported him, and he continues to cover the Unification Ministry.Other journalists , defectors and human rights activists sprang to Kim's defense and slammed the ministry's action. Among them was defector Choi Kyong Hui, president of a civic group called South and North Development. who pointed out that Kim was going to cover talks in South Korea, not North Korea.\"In a democratic society,\" she argues, \"no individual or official has the right to restrict journalists working for the people's right to know.\"The ministry never apologized to Kim.The ministry budgets approximately 500 million South Korean won or about $449,000 per year for defector groups it considers \"civic movements for unification,\" but some defector groups complain that the ministry has cut funding for their activities.Kim, 43, grew up in Hamhung, North Korea's second-largest city, and studied information technology. He left North Korea in the 1990s, after listening to South Korean broadcasts on shortwave radio, which could pick up signals from the South.He was amazed to learn from those broadcasts that North Korea's poverty and famine were largely the result of its own policies.\"Once I found the truth, I grew to hate the North Korean regime,\" he says. \"I didn't want to sit and watch the North Korean television jabber every day. I felt a strong urge to experience life in the outside world.\"After years on the run in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, which he had entered illegally, Kim finally made it to South Korea in 2002.Now, Kim says he fears that amid the diplomatic courtship between the two Koreas, defectors are being silenced and South Korea may be falling into a trap.A defector and cartoonist says he was booted from a radio show after criticizing Kim Jong Un, though the network denied it. Another defector and activist says news programs shunned him after he spoke unceremoniously of Kim's sister.\"Our government is betting everything on peace negotiation with the North,\" he says. \"I am concerned that they're leaning too far to one side. The nature of North Korean regime hasn't changed.\"South Korean President Moon Jae-in is a veteran human rights lawyer who has spoken up for press freedom. In a speech on Human Rights Day last month, he linked human rights with improved relations with the North. \"Peace will guarantee human rights, and that will secure peace,\" he declared.Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to the president on foreign affairs and national security, says resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is the administration's top priority. When it comes to North Korean defectors, he is blunt: \"North Korean defectors might not enjoy the same benefits that they enjoyed during the two previous conservative governments,\" he says.By the same token, South Koreans who have publicly welcomed news of the North Korean leader's expected visit to Seoul are now free to express their support of Kim, something that might have resulted in prosecution under national security laws during previous administrations.All this makes Kim Myong Song apprehensive about his future as a journalist in South Korea. Before the government banned him from covering the inter-Korean meeting, he says, the peace process had actually given him hope: that someday he could report from Pyongyang, as a South Korean correspondent. These days, it seems he can't even report freely from Seoul. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

      "Text: Two days of fighting in rebel-held parts of northern Syria killed dozens of people as al-Qaida-linked militants press their offensive against Turkey-backed rebels, a war monitor and activists said Wednesday.The new wave of fighting comes after President Donald Trump's abrupt announcement in mid-December that he was withdrawing 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and Turkish threats to carry out a military operation against Kurdish fighters.With their offensive, the al-Qaida-linked fighters are trying to cut off Turkey-backed fighters in the northern enclave of Afrin from those in the northwestern province of Idlib, amid concerns that Turkey might make a deal with Russia at the expense of the extremists, said Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\"They are trying to say we are present and no one should ignore us,'' he said of the al-Qaida-linked fighters.The al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee and the Turkey-backed Nour el-Din el-Zinki group blamed each other for triggering the fighting, the worst in nearly three months.The Observatory said two days of fighting in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib have killed 31 people, including five civilians. Also killed were 14 al-Qaida-linked fighters and 12 Turkey-backed gunmen.The government-controlled Syrian Central Military Media said al-Qaida-linked fighters are now in full control of the strategic town of Daret Azzeh and have also captured the villages of Kafrantin, Fadra, Houta and Mkalbis.The Levant Liberation Committee said Nour el-Din el-Zinki militants shot dead five people, including four of its fighters, last week. It added that a local court released an official with the Nour el-Din el-Zinki after questioning him leading to tensions in the area.Abdurrahman said al-Qaida-linked HTS took the killing as a pretext to launch its attack.\n",

      "Text: Uga, the University of Georgia mascot, sits near the sideline during the second half of the NCAA Sugar Bowl game against Texas in New Orleans on Jan. 1. Rusty Costanza / AP Texas Longhorns mascot Bevo XV, entering the stadium before the game against the TCU Horned Frogs on Sept. 22, 2018 in Austin, Texas. Tim Warner / Tim Warner Originally published on January 2, 2019 3:36 amIt is a philosophical question often pondered by sports writers and curious Redditors : If every college mascot were to fight each other, which would stand victorious when the dust cleared?Up until now, the question has been purely academic. But during the Sugar Bowl pre-game festivities Tuesday night in New Orleans, viewers almost got an answer to one no-longer-hypothetical match-up.The University of Texas at Austin Longhorns mascot is Bevo, a longhorn steer weighing in at 1,600 pounds and armed with two spear-like horns that span 58 inches . The University of Georgia Bulldogs mascot is Uga, an English bulldog tipping the scales at 62 pounds . Uga has no horns, but he does wear a festive spiked collar.With just under an hour before kickoff, handlers were trying to arrange Bevo and Uga for a photo-op on the sidelines of the Superdome. Suddenly and without warning, Bevo broke through the metal barrier separating the two mascots and charged toward the pup. Video of the melee shows Uga running for his life, as Bevo comes perilously close to hooking histiny opponent (not to mention almost trampling several humans along the way).One of Bevo's handlers, Texas senior Patrick Dowell, told ESPN that the steer was \"just going to say hi\" to the little dog. John Baker, owner of the ranch where Bevo was bred, said that Bevo is actually \"as docile as a lamb.\"Many on Twitter chastised Uga's wardrobe artists for clothing him in the school's colors: red and black. But the color red doesn't actually make bulls charge . Bulls (and all cattle) are color-blind; they charge the matador's muleta not because it's red, but because it's moving .The mascots' handlers were able to restore order, robbing interspecies speculators of the chance to know definitively who would win in a fight between a steer and a bulldog. As for the human match-up that took place afterward, the answer is clear: The No. 15 Longhorns handily defeated the No. 5 Bulldogs, winning the Sugar Bowl 28-21. Copyright 2019 NPR.

      "Text: Millions Form a 300-Mile Human Chain to Protest Sexism in IndiaSupported by Millions Form a 300-Mile Human Chain to Protest Sexism in India Image Women stood shoulder to shoulder in the southern Indian state of Kerala on Tuesday to protest sexism and oppression. Credit Credit R.S. Iyer/Associated Press By Kai Schultz and Ayesha Venkataraman Jan. 2, 2019 NEW DELHI — For a few moments on New Year’s Day, millions of women stood shoulder to shoulder along highways in southern India, creating a human wall 300 miles long intended to stand fast against sexism and oppression. “We are taking the pledge that we will uphold renaissance values,” they chanted. “We will stand for equality for women! We will fight for secularism!” Though Indians often demonstrate through so-called human chains , the “women’s wall” in the state of Kerala on Tuesday was extraordinary for what prompted it. For months, women in India have led a revolt. In the fall, the country’s nascent #MeToo movement suddenly jolted forward. Dozens of urban women posted graphic stories on social media of sexual assault and harassment by public figures in journalism, entertainment, the arts and the highest levels of government . Their protests were unusually successful, and many of the accused men resigned. More barriers fell in the hours after the women joined hands. Soon after the wall disbanded, shaky video surfaced of two women in long black robes stepping through the golden doors of the Sabarimala Temple, a centuries-old Hindu shrine in Kerala that draws millions of pilgrims every year. Image Two women, identified only as Kanakadurga, center, and Bindu, near the Sabarimala Temple in December. They were said to have peacefully entered the Hindu shrine early Wednesday. Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images When India’s Supreme Court struck down a rule barring women of childbearing age from the temple, ruling the exclusion unconstitutional, thousands of protesters blocked the entrance of the temple. Several dozen women had tried to enter the temple, but none made it inside . Angry mobs of men, many of them linked to far-right Hindu nationalist groups, shouted in their faces or threw rocks at them. Habeeb Ullah, a police officer stationed near the Sabarimala Temple, said the two Hindu women, whose names were given only as Bindu and Kanakadurga, who peacefully entered around 3:45 a.m. Wednesday were “real heroines.” Access to the temple was but one concern for the many women forming Tuesday’s wall. They preferred to see the gathering as a broad opportunity to highlight gender equality in a country recently named the world’s most dangerous for women. The Communist Party of India, which governs the state and sponsored the gathering, said Kerala would never again become a “ lunatic asylum .” Addressing a crowd on Tuesday, Subhashini Ali, a member of the party, pushed the rhetoric further , calling out “evil forces” that were trying to manage women’s choices by creating “a floodlike crisis in the name of casteism, tradition and culture.” Image A priest performed purification rituals at the Sabarimala Temple on Wednesday.

Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “We can speak for ourselves,” she said onstage in the city of Kochi. “We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward.” The backgrounds of those forming the wall were mixed. Women came in saris, burqas, nuns’ habits and jeans. Men joined. Participants raised their arms with clenched fists, chattering about raising quotas for women in government posts and improving access for Dalits, low-caste Indians once known as untouchables. In some areas, crowds swelled so much that participants had to form rows several people deep. By the afternoon, as many as five million people were believed to be involved, creating a line that stretched north along the coast from the state’s capital, Thiruvananthapuram. Over 1,000 miles away, smaller groups in the capital, New Delhi, gathered in solidarity. “It was not just a wall,” said Sajitha Manaakat Veettil, 32, a teacher who participated from Kerala, “it was a great wall.” Though Kerala’s development measures are better than most Indian states, attributable to higher levels of education and literacy, many participants were realistic about the challenges women face across the country. When news broke that women had made it inside the Sabarimala Temple, for instance, a Hindu priest shut down the complex for “purification rituals,” which typically occur when blood is spilled or children accidentally urinate. Image The Sabarimala temple in October. A month earlier India’s Supreme Court ruled a ban on women from entering the temple was unconstitutional. Credit Sivaram V/Reuters Protests, fanned by political leaders, broke out around Kerala. According to local news reports , the police moved relatives of one of the woman who entered the temple into a safe house. Members of India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which is center-right but has ties to Hindu nationalist groups, called news of the women’s entry a “black day.” Other parties also protested, demanding the resignation of top officials in Kerala. B. Gopalakrishnan, a spokesman for the B.J.P. in Kerala, said some of the women joining the wall had been forced to attend. His cousin’s employer, he said, had told her that if she did not participate in the protest she would lose work opportunities. Some people were bribed to attend, he said. “This is not a woman’s wall, it is a compulsion wall,” he said. Bhakti Pasrija Sethi, a lawyer based in New Delhi who was involved in challenging the temple’s entry restrictions, dismissed those assertions, saying the wall was an “indicator of the strong will of ladies who believe the ban is a superstition.” The last 24 hours offered a peek at a more inclusive year, Ms. Sethi said. “This is a harbinger of further good things,” she said. “It’s great. It’s great. It’s great.”Kai Schultz reported from New Delhi, and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.Follow Kai Schultz and Ayesha Venkataraman on Twitter: @Kai_Schultz and @ayeshavenky1 .

      "Text: U.S. Agents Fire Tear Gas At Migrants Trying To Cross Mexico Border By editor • 6 hours ago Migrants run as tear gas is thrown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to the Mexican side of the border fence after they climbed the fence to get to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. Daniel Ochoa de Olza / AP Listen / Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:06 amAmerican border protection agents fired tear gas into Mexico early Tuesday aimed at about 150 migrants who were trying to scale over and crawl under a border fence to cross into the U.S., according to The Associated Press .White clouds of the acrid smoke could be seen wafting over the migrants' heads in video captured by Reuters . Migrants coughed and bent over as they walked through the haze. At least one person hurled a canister back toward U.S. agents.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security claims the migrants were \"a violent mob\" who attacked U.S. agents with projectiles. Katie Waldman told reporter Wendy Fry \"the mob began pushing women and minors to the front, forcing minors to climb dangerous concertina wire, and encouraged conveniently invited media to begin filming their illegal acts.\"An AP photographer at the scene says the migrants began throwing rocks after the tear gas was fired.The men, women and children on the Mexican side of the border arrived with the caravan of thousands of migrants who say they are fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. Most have been stopped in Mexico, and have been waiting in shelters in Tijuana for weeks for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S. Several of the migrants told the Los Angeles Times they tried to cross the border illegally after growing frustrated with the deadlocked process.Amnesty International deputy director of research Justin Mazzola condemned the firing of tear gas as \"cruel and inhumane\" and has called for an investigation into the incident.\"The Trump administration is defying international law and orchestrating a crisis by deliberately turning asylum-seekers away from ports of entry, endangering families who see no choice but to take desperate measures in their search for protection,\" Mazzola says in a statement.In November, American border agents fired tear gas at a crowd of migrants moving toward the U.S.-Mexico border. After that incident, the U.S. temporarily closed the San Ysidro border crossing.The issue of border securityhas paralyzed the government after President Trump demanded an additional $5 billion in funding for securing the frontier and Democrats refused. The federal government began its 12th day of a partial shutdown Wednesday; it is unlikely to end before Congress resumes on Jan. 3. That's the day Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, and the chamber is expected to vote on a bill to end the shutdown.DHS Spokeswoman Waldman added in her statement, \"Congress needs to fully fund the border wall.\"DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited the border over the weekend in Texas to inspect migrant processing facilities and medical screenings of children. Her visit came after two Guatemalan children died in U.S. custody in December.Independent of border funding, the Trump administration has taken steps to tighten rules around asylum seekers. The White House announced in December that Mexico , rather than the U.S., will house migrants while they wait for their asylum cases to be processed.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told NPR's Steve Inskeep , \"We think this will disincentivize folks who think that if they can make the transit through Mexico — a very difficult and arduous journey where terrible things often happen to these migrants — we think they will realize that they won't be able to stay in the United States and disappear into our country.\"The White House has also attempted to prevent migrants from applying for asylum if they cross the border illegally, and to rule that domestic abuse or gang violence does not qualify migrants for asylum. Judges in California and Washington, D.C., struck down both those measures . Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

      "Artist Nigel Cooke returns to Hastings for new show at Jerwood Gallery Nigel Cooke Published: 13:06 Wednesday 02 January 2019 Share this articleFrom January 19, Jerwood Gallery will premiere previously unseen and new works by critically acclaimed artist Nigel Cooke in an exhibition entitled Painter’s Beach Club.The show is something of a homecoming for Cooke - who mixes music, the weather and memories of growing up in Manchester to create his work - as Hastings is where he first had his paintings shown as a professional artist.Cooke said: “Coming back to Hastings after many adventures - in painting and the art world in general - to mount a show, has the feel of an odyssey. That’s the thing about painting; no matter how far you think you travel, you always end up back at the beginning.”He added: “A lot of my work has the shoreline as its location and, because Jerwood Gallery is by the sea, I wanted to focus on this aspect. Like all of us straining to get to the beach when the sun is out, I like to set my paintings at a similar frontier, an idealistic background that the painting can react to.”On display will be works previously unseen in a UK public gallery which the New York Times recently described as combining “magic realist illusion, post-apocalyptic fantasy and extreme shifts of scale.”Cooke’s paintings, frequently on vast canvases, feature somewhat dystopian landscapes, peopled by a variety of oddball and yet recognisable characters. Each painting demands close inspection as, among the weeds, stones and rubble will be found graffiti-like slogans, motifs and painterly references to his artistic heroes, such as Francis Bacon, Velazquez and Goya. Cooke likes to work at close range and at a distance, so it often seems like each painting contains many smaller ones within it.Growing up in the North of England, Cooke studied an art foundation course at Stockport College prior to pursuing a degree course at Nottingham Trent University. In 1997 he completed an MA at the Royal College of Art before being awarded a PhD in Fine Art from Goldsmith’s College, London (2004).Today, Cooke’s work hangs in major collections around the world, including the Tate, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Guggenheim.For more information visit www.jerwoodgallery.org.\n",

      "When my son was born, I felt a new responsibility to make his world better, so I committed to recycling regularly. I also changed out a few light bulbs and planted a garden. Then, three years ago, I picked up Naomi Klein’s climate change masterpiece, “This Changes Everything.” And for the first time, I felt that no matter what I did on my own, it could never be enough.I am not alone. Yale Climate Communications recent survey headlines “ Americans are more worried about global warming, and show signs of losing hope .” Awareness is growing as more than six in 10 adults said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried about it, whereas fewer than half did in 2010.The American Psychiatric Association reports “Research indicates that extreme weather events such as large storms, flooding, droughts and heat waves are likely to become more frequent or more intense with climate change. Experiencing disasters related to climate and weather can cause significant stress and distress for many and contribute to more serious mental health issues.”What is the best antidote to feeling powerless about anything? Start doing something. Here are the steps I took to begin making a difference and being able to sleep at night.1. Read, listen and understand. Become climate change literate. What is it exactly and how does it work? There is a wealth of information out there. One of the best sites is citizensclimatelobby.org . These people know how to make a complex issue understandable. Now, make it personal. How is climate change affecting your region (agriculture, tourism, transportation, energy, economy). How does it affect your areas of interest (fly fishing, mountain biking, wildlife diversity, or skiing)? What do future forecasts and modeling predict for your area? Brace yourself; a bit of mental fortitude is helpful here for the somber news.2. Get involved using your special superpower! (You know you have one.) Given your unique talents, networks and skill-set, how can you contribute/advance climate change solutions? You might consider personal, community or national actions. Are you good at art, organizing, writing, teaching, researching or communication? This process may be an evolving path. Some individuals work best on their own, while others want the support and direction of an existing organization. Great organizations include: Citizens Climate Lobby, 350.org , Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and Climate Reality Project.3. Foster resilience. We’re in this for the long haul. My first big effort was to organize a community event to educate people about our food system as it relates to climate change with a documentary called “ Just Eat It: A Food Waste Story .” Let’s just say it was not well-attended, but I learned valuable lessons I used for my next event, and my next. Samuel Beckett, the great Irish playwright said it best: “Ever tried? Every failed? No matter. Fail again. Fail better.” Because every time you do, you’re moving us all forward.My favorite climate change books include, “Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming,” Paul Hawken; “Laudato Si: Encyclical on the Environment and Human Ecology,” Pope Francis; “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs Climate,” Naomi Klein; “Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?,” Bill McKibben; “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,” Peter Kalmus; “Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity,” James Hansen; “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,” Jared Diamond; “The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars” by Michael E. Mann.Good film documentaries on the subject include, “Chasing Ice,” “Chasing Corral,” “Years of Living Dangerously,” “Racing Extinction,” “Merchants of Doubt,” “Time to Choose,” “Tomorrow,” “Paris to Pittsburgh,” “Before the Flood,” “From the Ashes,” and “An Inconvenient Sequel.”Susan Atkinson , Durango, Colo., is a member of the Citizens Climate Lobby.\n",

      "Summary New report from BC Hydro says the Dec. 20 windstorm across the South Coast was the 'most damaging' storm in its historyVANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – At its peak, it knocked out power to more than three-quarters-of-a-million customers.Now, almost exactly three weeks later, BC Hydro says that wind storm that pummeled the South Coast was the worst in its history.A new report out by the utility suggest the December storm’s impacts were larger than the windstorm that hit in August of 2015, BC Hydro adds, which affected both the Lower Mainland and the Fraser Valley. It was also more impactful than the windstorm of 2006 that swept across Vancouver Island, and “devastated Stanley Park.”This most recent even hit B.C. on December 20th. It left more than 400,000 customers without power on the Lower Mainland, and nearly 350,000 BC Hydro customers without electricity across Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.As crews continue #BCStorm restoration work, here's a look at some of the significant damage we're seeing from #VancouverIsland #Bamfield #GulfIslands from the past few days. pic.twitter.com/1VxMUgsAYw— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 24, 2018“It also required the biggest mobilization of people, equipment, and materials in BC Hydro’s history to respond to it,” Mora Scott with the utility said.The storm was the most damaging for a couple of reasons, she explained.“One it impacted more customers than we’ve ever seen before,” she told NEWS 1130 . “And it was the most damaging in terms of electrical infrastructure. More than 3,000 pieces of equipment were damaged during this storm that needed to be replaced.”The weather system brought with it winds with speeds of up to 100 kilometres per hour in some areas. It toppled trees and branches, many of which came crashing down onto electrical equipment.Restoring remaining customers continues to be a challenge due to extent of #BCStorm damage. Hundreds of individual outages remain that crews have to attend individually to make repairs, including restringing hundreds of spans of power lines & replacing power poles, transformers. pic.twitter.com/KfbUlYWa7R— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 23, 2018Scott said about 1,900 spans of wire, 390 power poles, 700 cross arms, and about 230 transformers were damaged.“We did have about 900 field workers working around the clock to make repairs and to rebuild parts of the system,” she added.Crews continue to make good progress & have restored power to around 600,000 customers total since #BCStorm hit on Thursday. As some customers are still without power we’ll continue to update the status of the hardest hit communities here: https://t.co/zZ7C1InV8t pic.twitter.com/R2L9IyzM2b— BC Hydro (@bchydro) December 23, 2018Power was restored to more than half a million customers in the first 24 hours, the utility says. Crews were also brought in from other parts of the province and even outside of B.C.While crews have been called in from other areas in the past, Scott said “this was definitely the biggest mobilization of people, equipment, and material we’ve ever seen in our company’s history.”-With files from Estefania DuranRelated Stories More than 120,000 without power, trees down, as winds batter the Lower Mainland Person trapped on broken White Rock Pier rescued BC Hydro: Outages on Van Island and Gulf Islands restored by Dec. 31 Hydro crews work around the clock to restore power to British Columbians bc hydro | damage | electricity | historic | power | report | South Coast | storm | utility | windstorm\n",

      "Close Still hungover in Ryder Cup success, golf enters 2019 with same obsession over Tiger Woods’ twilightGolf enters the new year in the same Woods obsessive cycle, the old will he won’t he, the can he really, the oh he hasn’t surely Click to followSportTwo moments just seven days apart drunk in euphoria and magnums of merriment defined golf in 2018. First there was the superlunary sight of Tiger Woods marching towards the 18th green at East Lake Golf Club, the maniacal claque of ‘I was there’ disciples leapfrogging the fairway rope to watch the teary-eyed 42-year-old win his first tournament in 1,876 days and complete one of sport’s most remarkable comebacks.Then just five rounds later Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood doused and danced in a rain of champagne in another greenside mob, this time on the outskirts of Paris as Europe downed a feckless USA in the Ryder Cup .It was but a speck of the golfing calendar in September – 168 hours to be precise – yet shrouded the entirety of what came before: the two major triumphs of Brooks Koepka , the table-topping ranking of Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson’s own return as he won for the first time in 101 tournaments.

The twilight hour stretched into days after Tour Championship victory. The pursuit of a coveted 15th major which means so much in the immediate but ultimately little if he isn’t to surpass Jack Nicklaus’ 18 continues. This time, though, Woods enters each time as the favourite.

Perhaps now we will accept that if someone is to seize the game by the scruff of its tweed-acred collar in 2019 as Woods did over two decade ago, it will come from a younger generation who looked up to Woods’ aura rather than lived in its shadow.Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau are those pole-placed princes in waiting. Both Ryder Cup rookies who spent their childhood fawning over Woods montages, the just turned 24-year-old Rahm crowned a year where he won three events, peaked at No 2 in the world rankings and finished fourth in two of 2018’s majors by defeating Woods in the Sunday singles in Paris.Maverick American DeChambeau, a year Rahm’s senior and famed for his rigid one-plane swing and wild neuroticisms, won four PGA Tour events and peaked at No 5 in the world rankings. Both have the ability to dethrone their hero and now too a maturity to wear his pelt. Rahm celebrates after defeating Woods in the singles in Paris (Getty)They will also jostle in the prolonged battle for world No 1 status, exchanged a record nine times between Koepka, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson last year like an unwanted crust.Rose remains the most relentlessly consistent player on the planet – his maiden victory in the season-long FedEx Cup a testament to that – but as he nears 40, adding to an unbecoming tally of a lone major victory in the 2013 US Open takes on total priority. Rose has contended at a major ever year since 2011 and Augusta, where he was felled in a playoff by close friend Sergio Garcia in 2017, has always been well-tailored to his straight-hitting.Ryder Cup teammate Fleetwood also holds hopes of of going one better having finished 2nd at the US Open and starred at Le Golf National, while the always tempestuous Tyrrell Hatton and ever wry Eddie Pepperell head a rich contingent of English challengers hoping to build on career-best seasons. Georgia Hall became England’s first Open champion for 14 years in 2018 (Getty)But, of course, the greatest golf feat of 2018 came on home soil and not by way of any of the aforementioned names when Georgia Hall stunned South Korea’s indomitable golfing division to become England’s first Open champion for 14 years.Next September, the 22-year-old will spearhead Europe in the 16th edition Solheim Cup which takes place at Gleneagles and promises a huge boost to the women’s game. Certainly, it is the only team event worth seconds in 2019 as the President’s Cup offers up another futile procession of patriotic fanfare as the USA conquer the ‘rest of the world’. In 12 editions of the lopsided tournament, the International Team has won just once.No in 2019 golf returns to traditional etiquette. The gaze reverted to the rolling summer months of majors, even if the PGA persist in trying to group them together on one slope as a way of transforming the season-ending Tour Championship into an informal fifth rather than another vulgar money-spinner.Speaking of which, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson won’t promise to spare us of another nauseating pay-per-view match either.\n",

      "In Mexico, A Mayor Is Killed Within Hours Of Taking Office By Daniella Cheslow • 1 hour ago Alejandro Aparicio Santiago appears in a photograph issued by the Oaxaca state government. The newly elected mayor of the town of Tlaxiaco was killed within hours of taking office. Facebook.com/AlejandroAparicioMorena Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:01 amThe governor of the Mexican state of Oaxaca promises an investigation after a mayor of the town of Tlaxiaco was murdered. Gov. Alejandro Murat says a suspect is in custody.Alejandro Aparicio Santiago had just taken office Tuesday and was walking to his first official meeting at city hall when a group of gunmen opened fire. The mayor died in hospital, according to the Associated Press .Aparicio was a member of the Mexico's National Regeneration Movement, MORENA, the party of newly-elected President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The Oaxaca branch of the party issued condolences and a call for authorities to punish those responsible.Another MORENA politician was killed Sunday in the state of Morelos. The state government announced the death of María Ascención Torres Cruz on Twitter, writing, \"Que en paz descanse,\" Spanish for \"rest in peace.\"Last year more than 33,000 people were murdered in Mexico. NPR's Carrie Kahn reported that morgues overflowed and bodies were at times stored in refrigerated trailers, with residents complaining about the stench they generated.Holding public office can be particularly dangerous in parts of Mexico. The consulting firm Etellekt says that between September 2017 and August 2018, 175 politicians were murdered . That year included campaign season for the July 1 general elections.President Obrador campaigned on a platform of restoring order in Mexico by forming a National Guard. The new president has traveled with light security, riding in a Volkswagen sedan with only a handful of unarmed citizens providing protection , reports NPR.The Economist analyzed violence against mayors in Mexico and concluded that they were often targeted after they cracked down on corruption and local crime - or sometimes because they sided with gangs and were pursued by their rivals. In Oaxaca, the magazine noted, gangs were weak but mayors were killed in disputes over land. Unlike federal and state officials, who had heavy security, mayors are often exposed.Tlaxiaco is the hometown of the star of the film \"Roma,\" Yalitza Aparicio. It is unknown whether she is related to the slain mayor. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

      "Business BureauMARKET observers find prevailing financial conditions ideal for share market and believe that the year 2019 would continue to attract large number of foreign institutional investors (FIIs). They feel that the market would touch new high in 2019 as many conditions are expected to go inline the expectations of the investors.However, they look very much concerned about the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls scheduled in the year. Director of Badjate Shocks and Shares Private Limited - Anuj Badjate said that the stock market would behave differently in first and second half of the year. “The first half, which is the preelection period, is expected to witness volatility.There will be uncertainty in the market because of which the market might lack the sense of excitement and cheer. And the market will behave as per the election results in the second phase (the post election phase),” he observed. However, investors should feel comfortable during the first week. Marginal ups and downs in the market will not affect them. But there may be some risk for traders who need to be very cautious,” he said. Badjate also said that micro and macro economic indicators are very positive which is a healthy sign. “Apart from this, the recent financial quarter had reflected growth in corporate profits.I think that there will be a turnaround in corporate profits and it would show significant rise in 2019. Fiscal deficit and inflation are in control which is another reason for bringing excitement in the market,” he said. “If we get stable Government, the post - election phase will see markets going up,” he said. Past Chairman of Nagpur Chapter of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India - Kailash Jogani said that Lok Sabha election would play dominant role in 2019. “The election results will decide the future of the share market.The market always welcomes stable Government. The market will closely watch all the pre-poll alliances of political parties and number of parties forming it. If there will be no clear majority to any one, the market will behave negatively,” he predicted. Commenting on other aspects, Jogani said that consolidation of Indian currency against dollar and falling prices of crude oil are going to bring cheer in the market.“If we set aside the Lok Sabha elections, other parameters are very positive for the market and think Nifty should cross the 12,000 mark in 2019.The year offers good opportunities for investors,” he said. Renowned Chartered Accountant and financial expert - Sameer Bakre also echoed similar sentiments. He said that political developments will keep on impacting the market. “The investors wish to see consistency in policies which is feasible only there is a stable Government in place. And thus market will watch every move of major political parties in the coming days,” he said.“Similarly, Monsoon will also leave its impact on the market. Otherwise, Bakre said, 2019 appears very bullish. “Right now there is stress on the country’s financial system. The Government is aggressively taking care of NPAs, spending huge money on infrastructure projects. which is going to attract investors and market would go northwards,” he said.\n",

      "By Ashley Westerman • 2 hours ago A woman walks past a television in New Taipei City showing China's leader Xi Jinping making a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of a message sent to Taiwan in 1979. In his speech, Xi Jinping said Taiwan's unification with the mainland is \"inevitable\" and warned against any efforts to promote the island's independence. SAM YEH / AFP/Getty ImagesA Taiwan independent from mainland China is not an option, and no person or party can stop the trend toward \"unification,\" Chinese President Xi Jingping said in a policy speech Wednesday .While Beijing would seek a peaceful \"reunification\" with the self-governing island of over 23.5 million people, The Associated Press reports Xi said China wouldn't rule out using force if necessary. \"We are willing to create a vast space for peaceful unification, but we will never leave any room for any sort of Taiwan independence separatist activities,\" he said speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.Xi went on to say \"independence would only bring profound disaster for Taiwan\" and ensured the island a bright future under a one-country, two- system framework, according to Reuters.The Chinese president's urging for the two to come to the table came during a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the \"Message of Compatriots in Tawain\" when, on Jan. 1, 1979, China offered to open up communications and stop military action against the island. As NPR's Beijing Correspondent Rob Schmitz has reported previously , Taiwan split from China in 1949 when the U.S.-supported Chinese nationalist leadership fled after losing a civil war to communist forces.Then-president of Taiwan Chiang Ching-Kuo turned down Beijing's olive branch in 1979, reports Reuters, and later that year came out with the \"Three-Noes Policy\": no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.Decades later, China has again been rebuffed.In response to Xi's speech, current president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept Beijing's offered arrangement of \"one country, two systems,\" reports Reuters. In her own speech just the day before, Tsai, who is member of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, urged China to respect Taiwan's democratic values .More than 70 percent of Taiwanese believe Taiwan is already an independent country, according to an analysis done by The Washington Post. Unification with China has also become unpopular, the Post reports only one-third of Taiwanese citizens want to be part of China against — a drop from 60 percent who supported is in 2003.Only about 20 countries across the globe recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, which means different governments from Latin America to Africa have become drawn into the long-running diplomatic spat over the years. The U.S., which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from China, is no exception. While the State Department says the U.S. enjoys \"a robust unofficial relationship\" with Taiwan, right after his inauguration President Donald Trump called Xi and promised that Washington would stick to the \"One China\" doctrine. Then just a little over a year later, the U.S. dedicated a new complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has long functioned as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, NPR previously reported .Though he didn't name any country specifically, Xi warned Wednesday against foreign interference in China's \"Taiwan issue,\" saying family matters should be resolved by family members, reports the AP.

The Bookworm: Unraveling a mystery; modern motherhood Terri Schlichenmeyer, Columnist Published 5:02 a.m. ET Jan. 2, 2019 \"An Unexplained Death\" by Mikita Brottman. (Photo: Henry Holt) c. 2018, Henry Holt $28, $36.50 Canada; 273 pages Missing. That single word belies the deep panic and fear behind the reason for the poster it’s on. Someone's gone, not where he should be, and his family believes something’s wrong. They’re terrified because at some time in the ensuing days, as the poster falls to the elements and as you’ll read in “An Unexplained Death” by Mikita Brottman, missing can become mystery. In the early evening of May 16, 2006, Rey Rivera left his Baltimore home in a hurry, taking his wife’s car. He’d received what’s presumed to be a work-related phone call minutes before he left, but investigators still don’t know who called him. No one was ever able to ask because, days later, Rivera was found dead in Baltimore ’s Belvedere Hotel. He’d fallen through the roof into an abandoned office that had been a swimming pool in the Belvedere’s early years; but was now covered-over. The medical examiner said he hit the floor of the empty office, feet-first. More: The Bookworm: The alcohol at hand; shouldering the pain Mikita Brottman lived on the fifth floor of the grand old hotel-cum-condominium, and she was immediately captivated by Rivera’s passing. She admits that she’s always been fascinated in the “dark side,” in an X-Files sort of way, and death is of particular interest because of its unknowability. She admits that she’s tried all her life to experience the paranormal. She began digging deeper into what had become a mystery. Rivera was a tall athletic man, an immediately likeable kind of guy. He had a bit of a temper as a youth and was said to be impulsive with money, but his life seemed to be going well. Friends refused to believe that he killed himself. Though she’d never met Rivera, Brottman believed likewise but the more she learned, the odder the evidence. Rivera had just left a job that made him unhappy, for reasons that Brottman suggests were “tangled.” Details were forgotten, various players refused to speak with her, and documents were “lost.” And person after person after person warned Brottman to “be careful”… “An Unexplained Death” is the kind of book that’s perfect for the person who poked at road-kill as a child. It’s for the former kid who half-bravely half-thought about stumbling across a body in the woods someday, or who happily slept in a cemetery on Halloween. It’s creepy, and it’s very, very good. In her story, and that of Rey Rivera, author Mikita Brottman makes readers squirm. Not only do we learn a lot of shivery things about missing persons, but she also tells more about suicides, autopsies, and dead bodies than most true crime books would ever dare tell. Put it in a century-old hotel that’s seen its share of unsettling suicides, and you have a book that will make you cringe, check the locks, and read some more. Beware that this is not for anyone prone to nightmares. True crime fans may not like the personal injected into the process. But if you love a mystery that’ll leave you unnerved and twisting, “An Unexplained Death” should not be missed. “Forget ‘Having It All: How America Messed Up Motherhood – and How to Fix It' ” By Amy Westervelt c. 2018, Seal Press $27, $35 Canada; 309 pages First shift begins in early morning. You hit work then, and run all day for that weekly paycheck. Second shift starts the minute you pick up the kids and arrive home to run all evening until you fall into bed. Is this the way you wanted things to be or, after reading the new book “Forget ‘Having It All’” by Amy Westervelt, do you actually have too much?\"Forget 'Having It All: How America Messed Up Motherhood'\" by Amy Westervelt. (Photo: Seal Press) With two young children and a solid journalism career, Amy Westervelt is busy. She’s sometimes overloaded, which makes her think about motherhood in America versus motherhood elsewhere. Overseas, mothers get more support; here, not always so much. But to understand “why … motherhood in America kinda suck[s]” we first must know its history. Says Westervelt , America “was colonized by people who believed … in the power of self,” and that “led to both greatness and depravity.” It also led to a patriarchal society in which women “were seen as responsible for the moral character of their children” but men controlled white women’s lives, inheritances, childbirth, birth control, and most childcare decisions. Conversely, Black and Native American women generally reared their children communally – which, as it happens, is an ancient method and the way many societies raise their kids today. More: The Bookworm: Animal lovers, burro in; life's highway Modern mothers may enjoy more help from their spouses than their foremothers got but motherhood is still rather complicated. Women are criticized for “helicopter” mothering, and for giving their kids more freedom. They’re made to feel guilt for working, and for missing work when needed. They may be denied birth control but are given little-to-no governmental or societal support when they have children. Mothers of color, single mothers, and lesbian parents have these issues, and more. Says Westervelt, solutions start with demands for improved maternity leave, and for government-supported daycare. We should encourage boys to be nurturing. Passing the ERA would help, as would allowing better access to birth control. Finally, we need to stop shaming the choices women make, and “expand our notions of family to … go beyond the nuclear family.” While it’s true that a minute of browsing may tempt you to dismiss this book as just another feminist rant, hold up. Yes, author Amy Westervelt admits to both ranting and feminism and yes, there’s anger here. Still, “Forget ‘Having It All’” deserves a good second look. If nothing but for the history, this book will open eyes. You may think you know how your foremothers tried to raise families without losing identities, but Westervelt lays it bare again. You may think we’ve transcended old issues, but she shows how we’ve only re-arranged them. And you might think the grass is greener elsewhere, but she’s inclusive here: childless women and same-sex mothers don’t get off easy in today’s “messed up motherhood.” No doubt, this book is loaded with controversy, but it’s equally loaded with solutions. It’s one of those kinds of books that will make you want to take copious notes. If you’re so inclined, “Forget ‘Having It All’” may also be a book that shifts your thinking. The Bookworm is Terri Schlichenmeyer. She has been reading since she was 3 years old and never goes anywhere without a book. Terri lives on a hill in Wisconsin with two dogs and 11,000 books.

      "Greek police hunt for 2 fugitives who escaped prison by The Associated Press Posted Jan 2, 2019 5:07 am PSTATHENS, Greece — Greek police have launched a manhunt for two inmates who escaped from Greece’s largest prison at Korydallos, west of Athens, apparently by cutting the bars of their cell and scaling the prison walls.Police said Wednesday the two men, brothers who were convicted of thefts and robberies, apparently escaped after the evening rollcall Tuesday night. Police say they cut through the bars of their cell and emerged into a small courtyard, from where they used a makeshift rope and hook made of bag straps and a rock to scale the prison’s outer wall.Prison authorities discovered the prison break Wednesday morning during rollcall. Authorities have launched an investigation into how the men managed to escape.The Associated Press Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).

Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images Central American migrants make their way to local buses after being dropped off in El Paso, Texas, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Christmas Day. Paul Ratje / AFP/Getty Images President Trump speaks to members of the U.S. military during an unannounced trip to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Dec. 26. Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images A police officer stands near the U.S. Capitol during a partial government shutdown in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP/Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, the last day of the trading year. Spencer Platt / Getty ImagesPresents were exchanged, carols were sung and the political news cycle kept on churning over the Christmas holiday.The days surrounding Christmas and New Year's Day saw the partial government shutdown begin, the stock market take a tumble (then recover) and President Trump make a secret holiday visit to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.As 2019 begins, here's a look at what you may have missed over the holidays.Saturday, Dec. 22Just after midnight, the partial government shutdown began after Congress failed to reach a deal on a spending bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said it was up to Democratic leaders to cut a deal with Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The partial shutdown is the third time the government was shuttered in 2018.Monday, Dec. 24The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst Christmas Eve performance in history , dropping 2.9 percent in just half a day of trading. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index fell more than 2 percent on the day.The volatile day on Wall Street followed an unusual public statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in which he said he spoke with the CEOs of the six largest banks in the country and was assured of their lending capacity.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Trump spent the day posting a flurry of tweets, including an attack on the Federal Reserve , a thank-you message to Saudi Arabia and several tweets about the border wall .Trump also tweeted that he was \"alone\" in the White House and \"waiting\" on Democrats to make a deal with him on funding the southern border wall.That evening, Trump and first lady Melania Trump participated in NORAD's annual Santa tracking event.In a clip that soon went viral on Twitter, Trump could be heard asking one young girl calling for an update on Santa's whereabouts: \"Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7 it's marginal, right?\"The girl, later identified by the Charleston Post and Courier as 7-year-old Collman Lloyd of Lexington, S.C., said she still believes in Santa after the phone call with Trump — while noting she had never heard the word \"marginal\" before.Tuesday, Dec. 25Trump took to Twitter Christmas evening to wish a Merry Christmas to \" everyone, even the Fake News Media. \" Earlier in the day he made phone calls to U.S. service members stationed overseas, and afterward vented to reporters about Democrats and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\"It's a disgrace, what's happening in our country,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.\"On the same day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala had died in U.S. custody , the second child in December to die in custody after being apprehended by the CBP.Immigration and Customs Enforcement also drew attention as the agency continued releasing hundreds of asylum-seeking migrants near a bus station in El Paso, Texas. Outgoing Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke responded to ICE's action by tweeting a call for donations for the families the agency released.Wednesday, Dec. 26The day after Christmas was a busy one. Here are the highlights: Trump and the first lady made a secret visit to U.S. troops in Iraq . It was the first such visit for Trump since he took office nearly two years ago, and it followed his order to pull out troops from Syria days before. NPR's Tamara Keith was one of the reporters on the trip and recounted her experience keeping the secret from everyone but two people: her husband and her editor. After the death of a second migrant child in U.S. custody, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced a series of new medical checks for migrants detained at the U.S. border and an increase in medical staffing along the border. The stock market roared back after its historic Christmas Eve losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,000 points, the largest single-day point gain in its history. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also saw big gains. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital after she underwent surgery for early stage lung cancer.Thursday, Dec. 27It became clear the partial government shutdown would last into the new year after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., advised members that no votes were expected in the House for the remainder of the week. Neither Trump nor Democratic leaders showed signs of backing down, each issuing statements blaming the other for the shutdown.One consequence of the continued shutdown: the Smithsonian announced it would close all of its museums and the National Zoo on Jan. 2 unless a spending deal could be reached.Friday, Dec. 28Nielsen traveled to the southern U.S. border after the death of two migrant children in U.S. custody, citing an \"unprecedented\" increase in the number of families and children being apprehended.The partial government shutdown stretched into its sixth day on Friday, and government workers living paycheck to paycheck began worrying about their ability to pay the bills should the shutdown continue.Saturday, Dec. 29Trump again took to Twitter to chide Democrats for not agreeing to his demands for border wall funding. The president also said on Twitter that \"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies....\"Trump also claimed \" big progress \" was being made on a trade deal with China as the trade war between the two countries continues.As New Year's Day approached, more impacts of the partial shutdown became apparent. For example, a group of volunteers descended on Joshua Tree National Park to scrub toilets, restock toilet paper and clean trash in place of the National Park Service. Among many other impacts, the Environmental Protection Agency also announced it would halt its operations.Monday, Dec. 31Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she would form an exploratory committee — essentially launching her 2020 presidential campaign . She made the announcement in a video emailed to supporters, touting her work on consumer financial protections and vowing that Trump could be defeated in 2020.In Capitol Hill news, a Democratic leadership aide said the House of Representatives will vote on a bill to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday — the day Democrats take control of the chamber. The bill will include full-year appropriations for six of the seven outstanding funding bills and temporary stopgap funding for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8.And on Wall Street, all three major stock market indexes closed 2018 down for the year .As 2018 drew to a close, our political journalists looked back on some of the most important stories of the year, including: The year in scandals , which saw three Cabinet secretaries depart over ethics concerns and two Republican lawmakers charged with crimes.

      "Unexpected Ways The Government Shutdown Might Affect You By Cat Schuknecht • 3 hours ago Starting Wednesday, you won't be able to ride this bald eagle Wednesday at the carousel at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo, along with every Smithsonian museum, is closed to the public due to the partial government shutdown. Matt McClain / The Washington Post/Getty Images Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:12 amAs the federal government enters the second full week of its partial shutdown, federal workers aren't the only ones who will be affected.A new congressional session starts on Thursday, with Democrats as the majority in the House, but there's no indication that the shutdown will end before then.Consumers across the country might notice the consequences of the shutdown in unexpected places, from poop in parks to closed museums.Good night, gorilla: Every Smithsonian museum — even the National Zoo — is expected to close to the public on Wednesday. The institutions have relied on funds from previous years to stay open through the first of the New Year, but plan to close their doors on Jan. 2 if the government shutdown continues.\"It's really disappointing for our public because we know so many people come to Washington with plans to visit the Smithsonian museums, which are free,\" Smithsonian spokesperson Linda St. Thomas told WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons. \"And they really plan on that being a part of their visit to the city.\"Leave no trace: About two weeks into the shutdown, garbage and human waste are piling up in Yosemite National Park, The Los Angeles Times reported . The park has stayed stayed open since the shutdown began, making do with fewer resources, like bathrooms. Without access to restrooms, some park visitors are relieving themselves outside, but they aren't following the park services' recommendation to pack and carry out or bury their solid waste. As a result, some areas of the park, including \"all snow play areas,\" have been been closed .\"It's a free-for-all,\" Dakota Snider, who lives in Yosemite Valley, told The Associated Press on Monday. \"It's so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I've seen in my four years living here.\"Yosemite isn't the only park impacted by the shutdown; trash and toilets are a problem in Joshua Tree and Pinnacles National Park in California, and at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Other parks like Arches and Canyonlands in Utah and Yellowstone National Park have announced full or partial closures due to personnel shortages. And beware of checking nps.org for updates; the website won't be updated during the shutdown.Loans lost: Several government agencies that give out loans have had their purse strings tied by the federal shutdown. NPR's Shannon Van Sant reported last month that new housing development grants and housing quality inspections may be delayed. So could loans for new homebuyers.The Small Business Administration also won't be able to process loan applications that startups and small business owners use to get funding, USA Today reports .The Department of Agriculture also announced last week that it won't be issuing any new rural development loans, which are designed to aid home, business and utility development in rural areas.Pinching pennies: Visitors to Washington, D.C., might notice that a few local businesses are trying to help ease some of the financial stress — or at least the emotional stress — of the shutdown.In the capital, some restaurants are offering deals on food to anyone with a government employee ID. Celebrity chef José Andres promised free lunch for furloughed federal workers at any of his D.C. restaurants, NPR's Bobby Allyn reported .Capitol Lounge even released a menu of shutdown-themed cocktails, including a vodka-based \"Nothing Really Mattis\" and a tequila-infused \"Border Wall Banger.\" Copyright 2019 NPR.

      "Crowdfunding Drives Funds And Attention Toward Questionable Medical Treatments By Rachel D. Cohen • 3 hours ago Sara Wong for NPRFor deep water divers who decompress too quickly, doctors may advise they lie inside a pressurized glass tube and inhale pure oxygen to treat painful symptoms known as \"the bends.\" The oxygen boost is thought to reduce swelling and prevent infection.The treatment, known as hyperbaric oxygen therapy or HBOT, is approved for a few other conditions , like carbon monoxide poisoning and a form of gangrene. But some clinics around the country offer it for numerous other health problems, including migraine headaches, depression, strokes, and even brain injuries. And HBOT hasn't been proven to work for most of these, according to the FDA .That hasn't stopped many people from fundraising for the treatment — and many other unproven or alternative treatments — on crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and YouCaring (GoFundMe bought YouCaring in April 2018 ).In two studies published recently, researchers ran systematic searches through crowdfunding sites to see just how pervasive this issue is. They identified thousands of campaigns raising millions of dollars for medical treatments that are not backed by science.\"It's wasteful both for the patient and the donor, and potentially dangerous,\" says Dr. Ford Vox , a brain injury specialist in Atlanta and the author of one of the studies.Crowdfunding for medical bills, treatments and related expenses has become common , often filling in the gaps when people don't have insurance or their insurance doesn't cover all their expenses. In 2017, one third of the money raised on GoFundMe globally was directed toward self-categorized medical campaigns, according to the company. The platform hosts about a quarter million medical campaigns each year that raise over $650 million.But some portion of those funds are for treatments of questionable value. Vox's study, published in JAMA in October 2018, looked at five alternative treatments to serious medical issues: Homeopathic treatments for cancer, hyperbaric oxygen treatments for brain injuries, stem cell treatments for brain and spinal cord injuries, and long-term antibiotic treatments for chronic Lyme disease. And Vox says they could potentially lead to harm, either from side effects of the treatment or from the lost opportunity to receive treatments known to be effective.Vox and a team of researchers identified over a thousand active campaigns for the five treatments posted from 2015 to 2017. The campaigns asked for over $27 million and had raised nearly $7 million. Because it only looked at the five treatments during a narrow time frame, Vox says this research is merely a snapshot of what could be a much larger issue.\"The biggest issue I'm concerned about is potentially feeding this whole dubious area of medicine, quote unquote, that has always existed,\" Vox says. He says that as the crowdfunding market expands, and the sheer dollar amount raised by campaigns increases, \"so does the money going to this alternative medicine marketplace.\"Another study published in JAMA in May 2018 focused specifically on stem cell treatments. The authors searched crowdfunding platforms for people seeking treatment at more than 300 direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics, and found 100 campaigns seeking $7 million total.\"It doesn't take much time rummaging around crowdfunding sites to realize that there are a lot of campaigns for people seeking stem cell therapies,\" says Leigh Turner , a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics, and one of the study's authors.Stem cell therapies use stem cells in injections or tissue transplants to try to treat or prevent diseases. The FDA has approved stem cell treatments that use cells from cord blood to treat a limited group of disorders affecting the body system that produces blood. It warns most other types of stem cell therapy are unproven, and can be unsafe.'A shining moment'Michelle and John Witkowski had reached a point of desperation when their niece started a GoFundMe fundraiser so Michelle could get a stem cell treatment for her multiple sclerosis.\"It was a shining moment,\" John says, when they learned about StemGenex, one of the direct-to-consumer stem cell treatment facilities Turner identified in his paper. A friend's wife who had the same particularly aggressive form of MS had gotten stem cell treatment there and said she regained feeling in her left arm, which she hadn't been able to use for a while. The Witkowskis just had to figure out how they were going to pay for the nearly $15,000 treatment.John says they were not the asking type of people. That is, even after liquidating their 401(k) plans and spending roughly a half a million dollars on treatments throughout Michelle's 10-year battle with MS, they were hesitant to ask people for money.Yet they felt they had to try. \"The idea of something that may be able to help gives me hope, something I haven't had in a long time,\" Michelle explained on her GoFundMe campaign page.That hope may have been misplaced. Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl , the director of UCLA's Multiple Sclerosis Program, says that while there is legitimate research on stem cell therapies for MS and other illnesses, there are no definitive results yet.\"There are people at well-vetted institutions doing this work, and when it is safe, it will be approved,\" she says. \"I don't think it's a good idea to do things that are not FDA-approved.\"Turner understands why people fundraise for alternative treatments when they're in desperate situations. But he thinks both the clinics that offer these treatments and the crowdfunding sites bear responsibility for promoting unproven treatments — and false hopes.Right now, Turner says, clinics can basically advertise how they please, which allows them to market to vulnerable individuals.\"Should you be allowed to just kind of put up a website and claim that you have a stem cell treatment, you know, and then start charging people thousands or tens of thousands of dollars?\" he asks.In their GoFundMe campaign, the Witkowskis asked for $20,000 for Michelle's treatment and the accompanying expenses. While their fundraiser only shows they made $2,500, John says they raised much more than that. Friends and family members donated directly to them or wrote checks to the treatment center, StemGenex. And when a hat was passed around at John's office, he remembers he collected a couple thousand dollars.But after the stem cell therapy, Michelle didn't seem to get any better.\"Nothing helped. There were no victories. It's such a bummer,\" John says. Michelle died just a few months later.In late October the FDA issued a warning letter against StemGenex, the clinic where Michelle Witkowski got her procedure. The letter says that the agency considers StemGenex's product to be a drug, and that the company's manufacturing and quality control procedures are not in compliance with federal regulations regarding drug manufacturing. It also warns that their marketing violates federal law.In addition, a pending lawsuit alleges the company's marketing practices are deceptive. StemGenex denies the allegations .StemGenex did not reply to numerous requests for comment on this story.Turner and Vox both say that because crowdfunding sites are involved in a transaction that directs funds to unscientific treatments, they should be involved in mitigating the issue, by educating people about the risk of unproven treatments or by putting systems in place to identify problematic campaigns.\"As an organization, GoFundMe needs to think much more carefully and critically about the extent to which they're creating a website that can lead to the spread of misinformation, and what they can do to promote health literacy,\" Turner says.GoFundMe uses algorithms to detect campaigns that violate its terms of service , including ones that raise funds for \"illegal drugs, narcotics, steroids, controlled substances, pharmaceuticals or other products that make health claims that have not been approved or verified by the applicable local and/or national regulatory body.\"But Turner says he thinks they aren't applying these standards rigorously enough. He wonders if GoFundMe will alert crowdfunders trying to raise money for treatments at StemGenex about the FDA's warning letter.GoFundMe addressed Turner's comment in an emailed statement to NPR: \"With these new concerns being raised surrounding certain stem cell clinics, we are taking a thoughtful approach to addressing stem cell campaigns while continuing to provide a safe and secure place for people to fundraise for their needs and causes.\"'This is my body'Zubin Master, an associate consultant at Mayo Clinic's Biomedical Ethics Research Program, questions the extent to which crowdfunding sites bear responsibility to monitor medical campaigns like Witkowski's. \"They're not in the business of scientific oversight,\" he says.And according to Master, FDA approval alone may not be enough to go on when determining whether people should be allowed to fundraise for a particular treatment on the platform.Master says there is a grey area in what is considered a legitimate treatment. Physicians are allowed to innovate, to try off-label uses of medications for instance, and the FDA does not scrutinize each step of the care they provide, he says. In fact, if certain regulatory requirements are met, the FDA permits patients with life-threatening conditions to access non-FDA-approved treatments with physician oversight under the Expanded Access program. Master says direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics do not typically meet the requirements for this program.Overall, Master says, some unproven treatments may be more legitimate than others (for instance, they may be the subject of rigorous research). So, for crowdfunding companies, trying to judge among a spectrum of treatments, is \"like drawing a line in the sand.\"With 50 million users, Master wonders how GoFundMe would logistically weed out campaigns for non-scientific treatments on a case-by-case basis. \"I'm not sure where you would draw the line,\" Master says.The e-mailed statement from GoFundMe said they have policies, tools, and experts to \"ensure the safety and protection of our community.\"The statement went on to say: \"Our role is to provide people with social fundraising tools to raise money for their cause or need. While we hope to be a helpful resource for personal fundraising, we believe it is not our place to tell them what decision to make.\"Pete Canfield ran a GoFundMe campaign seeking stem cell treatment for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2016. Doctors had told him the disease, which had reduced his breathing capacity, was terminal. He says he made the decision to try the stem cell treatment with his \"eyes open, understanding that it was not a verified procedure.\"He says he feels it was his right to try an experimental treatment. \"This is my body and I get to make the choices about what I'm going to do with this body, for the most part,\" says Canfield.Canfield sought $10,000 to pay for a $6,000 stem cell therapy at another one of the direct-to-consumer clinics Turner identified in his paper. Additional funds were for his travel to the clinic.He didn't have much luck, just raising over $1,000, but he paid for the rest out of pocket. In the end, the stem cell therapy did not work for Canfield. Still, he says he doesn't regret trying.\"Going to experimental procedures is quite often an act of desperation,\" he explains. \"It's what we see as the only option: 'I have to do this because if I don't do this, there's a good chance I'm going to die.' \"Rachel D.

      "Laser diode system detects counterfeit olive oils02 Jan 2019Researchers at UCM Madrid and Scintillon Institute (US) develop sensor to detect fake oil – such as ordinary types sold as \"extra virgin\". The sensor can distinguish between apparently similar oils. Researchers at the Complutense University of Madrid , Spain, (UCM) and the Scintillon Institute in San Diego, Ca, US, have designed an optical sensor that can detect counterfeit olive oil labeled as extra virgin or protected designation of origin.The tool, reported in the Elsevier jornal Talanta , can distinguish between apparently similar oils that present notable differences in quality. This is possible thanks to the use of laser diodes, because the fluorescence emitted by adulterated oils is slightly different to that of pure “extra virgin” olive oils.Extra virgin olive oil is made from pure, cold-pressed olives, whereas regular olive oil is a blend, including both cold-pressed and processed oils, considered to be inferior in flavor, purity and appearance. A well-known example of fraudulent practice is adulterating fresh, pure virgin olive oil with inferior, cheaper olive oil or oils of another botanical origin.How it worksUsing a laser diode as a source light, the sample’s fluorescence emission is measured and 20 chaotic parameters from the resulting spectra have been calculated. Using these as independent variables of multi-parameter regression models, the concentration of adulterant can be estimated.The structure of the sensor has been designed and developed by a 3D printer and its developers say the device “has the potential of being applied in situ for real-time and cost-effective analysis at oil mills or for quality control.”The developers add that the tool is inexpensive both to manufacture and to operate. \"Other clear advantages of our tool include the possibility of conducting on-site analyses, as the equipment is the size of a briefcase. Furthermore, it generates results in real time,\" commented José S. Torrecilla, a senior lecturer and researcher in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials at UCM.The tool offers the olive oil sector a means to tackle an expensive problem. \"The quality of olive oil is recognised nationally and internationally. It is therefore necessary to protect this quality and combat fraudulent activities carried out with increasing frequency and skill in the sector,\" added Torrecilla.Chaotic algorithmsTo conduct the study, researchers mixed single-varietal oils of protected designation of origin with other protected designation of origin oils that were past their \"best before\" date. All the oils were purchased from grocery stores.Subsequently, mixtures were made using oils with between 1 and 17 percent acidity that were also past their \"best before\" date. Lastly, measurements were performed using the sensor, which was manufactured via 3-D printing, and the results were analyzed using chaotic algorithms.\"This technique is available for use at any time, and only requires oils prior to packaging for quality control or after packaging to detect fraudulent brands and/or producers,\" concluded Torrecilla.\n",

      "By Carrie Johnson • 3 hours ago A flag flies outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration's reshaping of the federal judiciary continued at a steady pace, with 18 new appeals court judges confirmed in 2018. Eric Thayer / Getty ImagesThe Trump administration more than doubled the number of judges it confirmed to federal appeals courts in 2018, exceeding the pace of the last five presidents and stocking the courts with lifetime appointees who could have profound consequences for civil rights, the environment and government regulations.A new analysis by Lambda Legal , which advocates for the LGBT community, reports that five of the country's 12 circuit courts are now composed of more than 25 percent of Trump-appointed judges.The report concludes that the 8th Circuit, which covers Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, has experienced the \"most significant transformation,\" followed by the 7th Circuit across the U.S. Midwest and the 5th Circuit, which spans Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana.Those courts play a major role in shaping the law, since they are often the destination of last resort. The Supreme Court agrees to hear only a small percentage of the petitions it reviews.\"Judges protect what we value most in society. No matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, or who you love, we all deserve judges who can be fair and impartial,\" said Sharon McGowan, legal director and chief strategy officer at Lambda Legal. \"That's why protecting our courts needs to be a two-party job. Democrats and Republicans alike owe it to the American people to ensure that the federal courts remain an impartial institution administering 'equal justice for all,' not just the wealthy and the powerful.\"Lambda Legal has closely followed the Trump judicial picks, because it argues the administration has been selecting candidates with a \"hostility\" toward LGBT people. That includes a judge who wrote that transgender people are \"delusional,\" and another who sat on the board of the Nebraska Family Alliance, which advocated for conversion therapy and against marriage equality.To conservatives, the Trump approach to judges represents the administration's most enduring legacy and a central reason he won the White House. Many of the Trump nominees are members of the Federalist Society, an elite group that has made a point of creating a pipeline of future judges.Last year, at its annual gala, the group honored former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — a nod to their success in confirming federal judges.In a year-end fundraising letter for 2018, the Society reported that its network now numbers 75,000 people and \"we are on the eve of closing a calendar year that was hardly imaginable in our early days.\"It continued: \"Our members--students, lawyers, law professors, legislators, public officials and more--are filling key positions in state and federal governments, in academia, and the private sector.\"The trend on judges is likely to continue this year, since Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. McConnell often points to confirming judges as a key success of the GOP-controlled Senate since Trump was elected. It's a message that may have boosted the enthusiasm of conservative voters in the midterm elections, particularly with the heated confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh coming just weeks earlier.Since Democrats won control of the House, effectively blocking the conservative legislative agenda for two years, confirming judges and other presidential appointees in the Senate is perhaps the clearest avenue for Trump to advance his agenda before facing re-election in 2020.With that political reality in mind, left-leaning groups know they are facing an uphill battle in the judiciary.Christopher Kang, chief counsel at the advocacy group Demand Justice, said he's \"heartened\" that Senate Democrats refused to do a deal to confirm more Trump picks at the end of 2018.But, he added, \"it's not enough for Democrats to simply stop fast-tracking Trump's judges — we have been calling on them to oppose every one. Trump's nominees are the most conservative in history, and Republicans have broken every rule, custom and norm possible to steamroll the Senate's constitutional responsibly. It's time for Democrats to do everything they can and unite in their opposition.\"Kang also pointed out that for all of Trump's success in filling judicial vacancies, only one African-American and one Hispanic judge have won confirmation in the Trump era.

      "The Latest: Russian apartment collapse death toll hits 21 by The Associated Press Posted Jan 2, 2019 4:30 am PSTMOSCOW — The Latest on the building collapse in Russia (all times local):3:25 p.m.Russian emergency officials say the death toll in the collapse of an apartment building has risen to 21 after the recovery of two more bodies from the rubble.The discovery of the bodies on Wednesday afternoon leaves 20 residents of the building in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk still unaccounted for. Prospects of finding anyone alive in the rubble have diminished sharply after two nights of harsh cold, with overnight temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).A section of the 10-story building collapsed on Monday following an explosion believed to have been due to a gas leak.___1:50 p.m.Search crews have pulled more bodies from a huge pile of rubble at a collapsed Russian apartment building, bringing the known death toll to 19.The bodies found on Wednesday in Magnitogorsk included a 3-year-old girl, Russian news agencies cited the emergencies ministry as saying.An 11-month-old boy who was pulled alive from the wreckage on Tuesday nearly 36 hours after the building collapsed was in serious but stable condition in a children’s hospital in Moscow. He was flown about 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) to the capital in a plane dispatched by the Health Ministry.Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said Wednesday the boy suffered superficial head wounds but no apparent brain damage.More than 20 people who lived in the building remain unaccounted for, including five children.The Associated Press\n",

      "By The Staff _No one can see the future, Save Jerseyans, but, as Scrooge discovered in A Christmas Carol , we’re sometimes able to glimpse “shadows of things that May be” should current events maintain their present trajectory.So yes, there are things which “we” (our regular contributors + insiders/veteran observers whom we informally polled to compile this list) can reasonably expect in New Jersey’s 2019 barring an environment-upsetting script flip over the next twelve months. And that’s the beautiful thing about the future! It isn’t written yet. We could be totally wrong on a few or even most predictions.Where a few of these predictions are concerned? We very much hope we’re wrong.For now, here are some predictions for the New Year:_ – MORE TAXES: The easiest one to predict by a mile!

Murphy will want more, Sweeney and Speaker Coughlin will argue him back a bit, and the legislative Dems will tout the resulting budget (the largest in N.J. history) as a “success.” It will be a success for Democrats in one very narrow sense of the word: a healthy number of Republicans will vote for the budget, giving Assembly Democrats running in battleground districts the cover they need to vote “no.” – MINIMUM WAGE: Legislation hiking New Jersey’s minimum wage will be passed and signed in 2019, but the state will opt for a circuitous route akin to what Seattle attempted as opposed to the relatively quick overnight hike to $15 per hour favored by the governor and the Democrat Party’s pro REgressive base. The seeds of division in New Jersey’s Democrat establishment — further fueled by a contentious state party chairmanship fight — will continue to take root. – LEGAL POT: Recreational cannabis legalization will be signed into law in 2019, too, but it won’t end up going into effect until after a prolonged period of regulation creation (the whole process has been rushed to date) and, when it finally launches, it will fetch only 2/3 of the revenue projected by Democrat leaders. Democrats will settle on a tax rate somewhere in the high teens. Murphy (left) and Brennan (right) – KATIE BRENNAN: Phil Murphy will survive the Katie Brennan scandal after some symbolic resignations and a tortured ‘apology’ for not doing more, but clear evidence that he KNOWINGLY ignored an alleged, credible female rape victim will haunt his long-term national ambitions in the same way that Bridgegate — and the persistent belief that Christie KNEW or approved of the plan to lean on Fort Lee’s Democrat mayor — bedeviled Murphy’s Republican predecessor (and continues to do so). – CHRIS CHRISTIE: …will conclude 2019 without a Trump Administration job. The Governor will surprise some by playing an active, behind-the-scenes role in the 2019 legislative elections here at home as well as the early stages of the 2021 gubernatorial race through the efforts of his long-time right hand man and NJGOP national committeeman Bill Palatucci. Christie’s new book – Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics – will be released on January 29th and end up being a moderate success driven by a substantial market for anything related to Trump. He will not re-friend Matt Rooney on Facebook or re-follow Save Jersey on Twitter. – ELECTION 2020 (Democrat): Actually THIS is the easiest one to predict! Gropacus (a/k/a Cory Booker) will announce a 2020 presidential campaign in early 2019 and spend most of his time Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina among other early primary/caucus states in addition to campaigning/fundraising for Democrat gubernatorial and legislative candidates across the country. Unfortunately for Booker, establishment options (like Biden and Clinton), the billionaire wildcard (Bloomberg), and the new leftist heroes of 2018 (like Beto and Gillium) will leave little oxygen in a crowded field for a well-known New Jersey candidate with a fraction of the purported electoral appeal to purple state voters of a Biden, Beto, or even a Gillium and less ideology purity (see Booker’s prescription drug votes) than some of other other popular options. He might make it to New Hampshire next winter. Might. – ELECTION 2020 (Republican): President Trump will host a reelection launch event by the end of 2019. One or a handful of GOP also-rans — like outgoing Ohio Governor John Kasich — will launch primary campaigns that go nowhere fast given Trump’s persistent popularity with a healthy majority of the Republican base. Trump will also end 2020 continuing to poll frustratingly well among Hispanic and Black voters. Trump’s strength with these groups (relative to Romney in 2012) may ultimately offset recent Republican weaknesses in affluent suburbs where the President’s style has turned off traditional GOP-leaning educated women. Only time will tell. Self-funders will announce in NJ-02, NJ-03 AND NJ-05; Seth Grossman will announce in the latter. Tom Kean Jr. will announce for NJ-07 but he will draw a primary challenge. – ELECTION 2019: Trump is the straw that’s breaking the back of a long-weakened New Jersey Republican establishment, and while “the bottom” is in sight, there’s still more losing ahead. Trenton Republicans are likely to suffer a narrow net loss in this year’s Assembly races; losses in Northern New Jersey suburban districts will be somewhat offset by pick ups in LD1 and LD2. Democrats may try to expand the map to LD12, LD26, and LD39, too, but those conquests will take more than one cycle. Republicans will fight like hell to hold on in Somerset and claw their way to a 2-3 minority on the Burlington freeholder board; the former fight will go to a recount, and the latter battle will come up a hair short. – IMMIGRATION: Trump and Democrats will reach a watered-down compromise on border security and DACA, one which leaves many unhappy on both sides of the aisle but one which also allows Trump to claim another legislative “victory.” His core supporters won’t mind; the shutdown will end with partial border wall funding, too. ICE will continue to clash with the Murphy Administration over this state’s sanctuary policies, conducting large-scale raids on a regular basis. – IMPEACHMENT: Mueller’s formal investigation will (finally) end and the President will come off looking bad in the final report. More indictments are coming. Trump will not be indicted notwithstanding the contents of Mueller’s final report, and the people who came out for him in 2016 knew he wasn’t an angel, so the political impact will be muted. House Democrats will fight among themselves over the far-left wing’s desire for a vote on articles of impeachment. The leadership will push back, worried about repeating the Republicans’ Clinton era impeachment mistake. Trump will raise a ton of money online off of the impeachment threat, giving the 2020 incumbent and his RNC a dramatic fundraising edge over the Democrat opposition. – ECONOMY: The stock market will continue to see-saw early in 2019 until a CR ends the partial government shutdown, though the threat of an impeachment vote continues to inject uncertainty into investors’ minds. A combination of cheap energy, growing wages, and a strong housing market nevertheless keep the economy growing albeit at a slower clip than it did throughout most of Trump’s first two years in office. New Jersey’s horrendous business tax climate and new taxes/regulations from the Murphy Administration will keep our state at the bottom of the national heap with anemic job growth._\n",

      "/ Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:06 amKim Myong Song, a reporter for one of South Korea's biggest daily newspapers, the Chosun Ilbo, remembers rushing to cover a high-level meeting of North and South Korean officials early one morning in October.Kim covers the Unification Ministry, which is in charge of inter-Korean relations. He also happens to be a defector from North Korea.On the way to the bus that would take him to Panmunjom, the border village where the talks were taking place, the ministry called to tell him he had been barred from covering the event.\"I felt so betrayed and angry,\" Kim tells NPR. \"I could understand it if I was an inexperienced newcomer. But I've been covering the ministry for six years.\"The ministry never really explained why it barred Kim. A spokesman simply said the ministry took \"necessary steps\" because of \"the special circumstance.\" He also noted that Kim is known for his \"active reporting,\" without elaborating.Its actions came at a time when the leaders of the two Koreas seem intent on taking unprecedented steps toward improving relations. The leaders of both countries met three times in 2018. Kim and other defectors believe that their experience of living under the North Korean regime gives them a role to play in this process.Kim speculates that officials shut him out because they were concerned that having a defector in the room could offend the North Korean officials and derail the talks.Kim is not the only defector turned journalist in South Korea, but he is the only one covering the Unification Ministry. This is the first known instance of the ministry targeting a specific journalist for exclusion.\"North Korea considers defectors as traitors to the country and the people,\" Kim explains, \"and they harshly criticize their activities in South Korea.\"Kim says his company has supported him, and he continues to cover the Unification Ministry.Other journalists , defectors and human rights activists sprang to Kim's defense and slammed the ministry's action. Among them was defector Choi Kyong Hui, president of a civic group called South and North Development. who pointed out that Kim was going to cover talks in South Korea, not North Korea.\"In a democratic society,\" she argues, \"no individual or official has the right to restrict journalists working for the people's right to know.\"The ministry never apologized to Kim.The ministry budgets approximately 500 million South Korean won or about $449,000 per year for defector groups it considers \"civic movements for unification,\" but some defector groups complain that the ministry has cut funding for their activities.Kim, 43, grew up in Hamhung, North Korea's second-largest city, and studied information technology. He left North Korea in the 1990s, after listening to South Korean broadcasts on shortwave radio, which could pick up signals from the South.He was amazed to learn from those broadcasts that North Korea's poverty and famine were largely the result of its own policies.\"Once I found the truth, I grew to hate the North Korean regime,\" he says. \"I didn't want to sit and watch the North Korean television jabber every day. I felt a strong urge to experience life in the outside world.\"After years on the run in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, which he had entered illegally, Kim finally made it to South Korea in 2002.Now, Kim says he fears that amid the diplomatic courtship between the two Koreas, defectors are being silenced and South Korea may be falling into a trap.A defector and cartoonist says he was booted from a radio show after criticizing Kim Jong Un, though the network denied it. Another defector and activist says news programs shunned him after he spoke unceremoniously of Kim's sister.\"Our government is betting everything on peace negotiation with the North,\" he says. \"I am concerned that they're leaning too far to one side. The nature of North Korean regime hasn't changed.\"South Korean President Moon Jae-in is a veteran human rights lawyer who has spoken up for press freedom. In a speech on Human Rights Day last month, he linked human rights with improved relations with the North. \"Peace will guarantee human rights, and that will secure peace,\" he declared.Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to the president on foreign affairs and national security, says resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is the administration's top priority. When it comes to North Korean defectors, he is blunt: \"North Korean defectors might not enjoy the same benefits that they enjoyed during the two previous conservative governments,\" he says.By the same token, South Koreans who have publicly welcomed news of the North Korean leader's expected visit to Seoul are now free to express their support of Kim, something that might have resulted in prosecution under national security laws during previous administrations.All this makes Kim Myong Song apprehensive about his future as a journalist in South Korea. Before the government banned him from covering the inter-Korean meeting, he says, the peace process had actually given him hope: that someday he could report from Pyongyang, as a South Korean correspondent. These days, it seems he can't even report freely from Seoul. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

      "Two days of fighting in rebel-held parts of northern Syria killed dozens of people as al-Qaida-linked militants press their offensive against Turkey-backed rebels, a war monitor and activists said Wednesday.The new wave of fighting comes after President Donald Trump's abrupt announcement in mid-December that he was withdrawing 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and Turkish threats to carry out a military operation against Kurdish fighters.With their offensive, the al-Qaida-linked fighters are trying to cut off Turkey-backed fighters in the northern enclave of Afrin from those in the northwestern province of Idlib, amid concerns that Turkey might make a deal with Russia at the expense of the extremists, said Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\"They are trying to say we are present and no one should ignore us,'' he said of the al-Qaida-linked fighters.The al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee and the Turkey-backed Nour el-Din el-Zinki group blamed each other for triggering the fighting, the worst in nearly three months.The Observatory said two days of fighting in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib have killed 31 people, including five civilians. Also killed were 14 al-Qaida-linked fighters and 12 Turkey-backed gunmen.The government-controlled Syrian Central Military Media said al-Qaida-linked fighters are now in full control of the strategic town of Daret Azzeh and have also captured the villages of Kafrantin, Fadra, Houta and Mkalbis.The Levant Liberation Committee said Nour el-Din el-Zinki militants shot dead five people, including four of its fighters, last week. It added that a local court released an official with the Nour el-Din el-Zinki after questioning him leading to tensions in the area.Abdurrahman said al-Qaida-linked HTS took the killing as a pretext to launch its attack.\n",

      "Uga, the University of Georgia mascot, sits near the sideline during the second half of the NCAA Sugar Bowl game against Texas in New Orleans on Jan. 1. Rusty Costanza / AP Texas Longhorns mascot Bevo XV, entering the stadium before the game against the TCU Horned Frogs on Sept. 22, 2018 in Austin, Texas. Tim Warner / Tim Warner Originally published on January 2, 2019 3:36 amIt is a philosophical question often pondered by sports writers and curious Redditors : If every college mascot were to fight each other, which would stand victorious when the dust cleared?Up until now, the question has been purely academic. But during the Sugar Bowl pre-game festivities Tuesday night in New Orleans, viewers almost got an answer to one no-longer-hypothetical match-up.The University of Texas at Austin Longhorns mascot is Bevo, a longhorn steer weighing in at 1,600 pounds and armed with two spear-like horns that span 58 inches . The University of Georgia Bulldogs mascot is Uga, an English bulldog tipping the scales at 62 pounds . Uga has no horns, but he does wear a festive spiked collar.With just under an hour before kickoff, handlers were trying to arrange Bevo and Uga for a photo-op on the sidelines of the Superdome. Suddenly and without warning, Bevo broke through the metal barrier separating the two mascots and charged toward the pup. Video of the melee shows Uga running for his life, as Bevo comes perilously close to hooking histiny opponent (not to mention almost trampling several humans along the way).One of Bevo's handlers, Texas senior Patrick Dowell, told ESPN that the steer was \"just going to say hi\" to the little dog. John Baker, owner of the ranch where Bevo was bred, said that Bevo is actually \"as docile as a lamb.\"Many on Twitter chastised Uga's wardrobe artists for clothing him in the school's colors: red and black. But the color red doesn't actually make bulls charge . Bulls (and all cattle) are color-blind; they charge the matador's muleta not because it's red, but because it's moving .The mascots' handlers were able to restore order, robbing interspecies speculators of the chance to know definitively who would win in a fight between a steer and a bulldog. As for the human match-up that took place afterward, the answer is clear: The No. 15 Longhorns handily defeated the No. 5 Bulldogs, winning the Sugar Bowl 28-21. Copyright 2019 NPR.

      "Millions Form a 300-Mile Human Chain to Protest Sexism in IndiaSupported by Millions Form a 300-Mile Human Chain to Protest Sexism in India Image Women stood shoulder to shoulder in the southern Indian state of Kerala on Tuesday to protest sexism and oppression. Credit Credit R.S. Iyer/Associated Press By Kai Schultz and Ayesha Venkataraman Jan. 2, 2019 NEW DELHI — For a few moments on New Year’s Day, millions of women stood shoulder to shoulder along highways in southern India, creating a human wall 300 miles long intended to stand fast against sexism and oppression. “We are taking the pledge that we will uphold renaissance values,” they chanted. “We will stand for equality for women! We will fight for secularism!” Though Indians often demonstrate through so-called human chains , the “women’s wall” in the state of Kerala on Tuesday was extraordinary for what prompted it. For months, women in India have led a revolt. In the fall, the country’s nascent #MeToo movement suddenly jolted forward. Dozens of urban women posted graphic stories on social media of sexual assault and harassment by public figures in journalism, entertainment, the arts and the highest levels of government . Their protests were unusually successful, and many of the accused men resigned. More barriers fell in the hours after the women joined hands. Soon after the wall disbanded, shaky video surfaced of two women in long black robes stepping through the golden doors of the Sabarimala Temple, a centuries-old Hindu shrine in Kerala that draws millions of pilgrims every year. Image Two women, identified only as Kanakadurga, center, and Bindu, near the Sabarimala Temple in December. They were said to have peacefully entered the Hindu shrine early Wednesday. Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images When India’s Supreme Court struck down a rule barring women of childbearing age from the temple, ruling the exclusion unconstitutional, thousands of protesters blocked the entrance of the temple. Several dozen women had tried to enter the temple, but none made it inside . Angry mobs of men, many of them linked to far-right Hindu nationalist groups, shouted in their faces or threw rocks at them. Habeeb Ullah, a police officer stationed near the Sabarimala Temple, said the two Hindu women, whose names were given only as Bindu and Kanakadurga, who peacefully entered around 3:45 a.m. Wednesday were “real heroines.” Access to the temple was but one concern for the many women forming Tuesday’s wall. They preferred to see the gathering as a broad opportunity to highlight gender equality in a country recently named the world’s most dangerous for women. The Communist Party of India, which governs the state and sponsored the gathering, said Kerala would never again become a “ lunatic asylum .” Addressing a crowd on Tuesday, Subhashini Ali, a member of the party, pushed the rhetoric further , calling out “evil forces” that were trying to manage women’s choices by creating “a floodlike crisis in the name of casteism, tradition and culture.” Image A priest performed purification rituals at the Sabarimala Temple on Wednesday. The Supreme Court struck down a rule barring women of childbearing age from entering the temple. Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “We can speak for ourselves,” she said onstage in the city of Kochi. “We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward.” The backgrounds of those forming the wall were mixed. Women came in saris, burqas, nuns’ habits and jeans. Men joined. Participants raised their arms with clenched fists, chattering about raising quotas for women in government posts and improving access for Dalits, low-caste Indians once known as untouchables. In some areas, crowds swelled so much that participants had to form rows several people deep. By the afternoon, as many as five million people were believed to be involved, creating a line that stretched north along the coast from the state’s capital, Thiruvananthapuram. Over 1,000 miles away, smaller groups in the capital, New Delhi, gathered in solidarity. “It was not just a wall,” said Sajitha Manaakat Veettil, 32, a teacher who participated from Kerala, “it was a great wall.” Though Kerala’s development measures are better than most Indian states, attributable to higher levels of education and literacy, many participants were realistic about the challenges women face across the country. When news broke that women had made it inside the Sabarimala Temple, for instance, a Hindu priest shut down the complex for “purification rituals,” which typically occur when blood is spilled or children accidentally urinate. Image The Sabarimala temple in October. A month earlier India’s Supreme Court ruled a ban on women from entering the temple was unconstitutional. Credit Sivaram V/Reuters Protests, fanned by political leaders, broke out around Kerala. According to local news reports , the police moved relatives of one of the woman who entered the temple into a safe house. Members of India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which is center-right but has ties to Hindu nationalist groups, called news of the women’s entry a “black day.” Other parties also protested, demanding the resignation of top officials in Kerala. B. Gopalakrishnan, a spokesman for the B.J.P. in Kerala, said some of the women joining the wall had been forced to attend. His cousin’s employer, he said, had told her that if she did not participate in the protest she would lose work opportunities. Some people were bribed to attend, he said. “This is not a woman’s wall, it is a compulsion wall,” he said. Bhakti Pasrija Sethi, a lawyer based in New Delhi who was involved in challenging the temple’s entry restrictions, dismissed those assertions, saying the wall was an “indicator of the strong will of ladies who believe the ban is a superstition.” The last 24 hours offered a peek at a more inclusive year, Ms. Sethi said. “This is a harbinger of further good things,” she said. “It’s great. It’s great. It’s great.”Kai Schultz reported from New Delhi, and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.Follow Kai Schultz and Ayesha Venkataraman on Twitter: @Kai_Schultz and @ayeshavenky1 .

      "U.S. Agents Fire Tear Gas At Migrants Trying To Cross Mexico Border By editor • 6 hours ago Migrants run as tear gas is thrown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to the Mexican side of the border fence after they climbed the fence to get to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. Daniel Ochoa de Olza / AP Listen / Originally published on January 2, 2019 8:06 amAmerican border protection agents fired tear gas into Mexico early Tuesday aimed at about 150 migrants who were trying to scale over and crawl under a border fence to cross into the U.S., according to The Associated Press .White clouds of the acrid smoke could be seen wafting over the migrants' heads in video captured by Reuters . Migrants coughed and bent over as they walked through the haze. At least one person hurled a canister back toward U.S. agents.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security claims the migrants were \"a violent mob\" who attacked U.S. agents with projectiles. Katie Waldman told reporter Wendy Fry \"the mob began pushing women and minors to the front, forcing minors to climb dangerous concertina wire, and encouraged conveniently invited media to begin filming their illegal acts.\"An AP photographer at the scene says the migrants began throwing rocks after the tear gas was fired.The men, women and children on the Mexican side of the border arrived with the caravan of thousands of migrants who say they are fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. Most have been stopped in Mexico, and have been waiting in shelters in Tijuana for weeks for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S. Several of the migrants told the Los Angeles Times they tried to cross the border illegally after growing frustrated with the deadlocked process.Amnesty International deputy director of research Justin Mazzola condemned the firing of tear gas as \"cruel and inhumane\" and has called for an investigation into the incident.\"The Trump administration is defying international law and orchestrating a crisis by deliberately turning asylum-seekers away from ports of entry, endangering families who see no choice but to take desperate measures in their search for protection,\" Mazzola says in a statement.In November, American border agents fired tear gas at a crowd of migrants moving toward the U.S.-Mexico border. After that incident, the U.S. temporarily closed the San Ysidro border crossing.The issue of border securityhas paralyzed the government after President Trump demanded an additional $5 billion in funding for securing the frontier and Democrats refused. The federal government began its 12th day of a partial shutdown Wednesday; it is unlikely to end before Congress resumes on Jan. 3. That's the day Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, and the chamber is expected to vote on a bill to end the shutdown.DHS Spokeswoman Waldman added in her statement, \"Congress needs to fully fund the border wall.\"DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited the border over the weekend in Texas to inspect migrant processing facilities and medical screenings of children. Her visit came after two Guatemalan children died in U.S. custody in December.Independent of border funding, the Trump administration has taken steps to tighten rules around asylum seekers. The White House announced in December that Mexico , rather than the U.S., will house migrants while they wait for their asylum cases to be processed.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told NPR's Steve Inskeep , \"We think this will disincentivize folks who think that if they can make the transit through Mexico — a very difficult and arduous journey where terrible things often happen to these migrants — we think they will realize that they won't be able to stay in the United States and disappear into our country.\"The White House has also attempted to prevent migrants from applying for asylum if they cross the border illegally, and to rule that domestic abuse or gang violence does not qualify migrants for asylum. Judges in California and Washington, D.C., struck down both those measures . Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 WESM\n",

I have seen Veterans increase their interaction. They connect by talking about their lessons and what they learn.\"George Meninno , 96-year-old World War II Veteran and Orlando CLC resident, is actively enrolled in the program for voice lessons. He says, \"The musical therapy has helped me 100%! I am breathing better, I am learning, and I am singing better. Before I thought I was singing well, but now I have much better vocal chords. This has helped me to improve!\"\"Most of the VA hospitals across the country use music therapy as a proven treatment, however they have limited resources to reach all veterans that need assistance,\" says Ted Gee , President of Live Music Tutor. Music therapy is a treatment to help VA hospital's quality of life indicators. LMT hopes to assist by providing a solution to improve quality of life indicators with our software technology platform and over 2000 instructors and licensed music therapists internationally.The pilot program was a huge success and culminated with a virtual holiday concert that was provided by Live Music Tutor instructors taking veteran's music request and playing holiday songs.For more information about this project, email us at info@livemusictutor.com or visit www.livemusictutor.com to learn more.ABOUT LIVE MUSIC TUTORFounded in 2011, Live Music Tutor, Inc.
